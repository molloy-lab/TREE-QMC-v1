Abstract:Recently, the Institute of Automation of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) released the unconstrained online and offline Chinese handwriting databases CASIA-OLHWDB and CASIA-HWDB, which contain isolated character samples and handwritten texts produced by 1020 writers. This paper presents our benchmarking results using state-of-the-art methods on the isolated character datasets OLHWDB1.0 and HWDB1.0 (called DB1.0 in general), OLHWDB1.1 and HWDB1.1 (called DB1.1 in general). The DB1.1 covers 3755 Chinese character classes as in the level-1 set of GB2312-80. The evaluated methods include 1D and pseudo 2D normalization methods, gradient direction feature extraction from binary images and from gray-scale images, online stroke direction feature extraction from pen-down trajectory and from pen lifts, classification using the modified quadratic discriminant function (MQDF), discriminative feature extraction (DFE), and discriminative learning quadratic discriminant function (DLQDF). Our experiments reported the highest test accuracies 89.55% and 93.22% on the HWDB1.1 (offline) and OLHWDB1.1 (online), respectively, when using the MQDF classifier trained with DB1.1. When training with both the DB1.0 and DB1.1, the test accuracies on HWDB1.1 and OLHWDB are improved to 90.71% and 93.95%, respectively. Using DFE and DLQDF, the best results on HWDB1.1 and OLHWDB1.1 are 92.08% and 94.85%, respectively. Our results are comparable to the best results of the ICDAR2011 Chinese Handwriting Recognition Competition though we used less training samples. &copy; 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

Abstract:Kolla and Tulsiani [KT07, Kol11] and Arora, Barak and Steurer [ABS10] introduced the technique of subspace enumeration, which gives approximation algorithms for graph problems such as unique games and small set expansion; the running time of such algorithms is exponential in the threshold-rank of the graph. Guruswami and Sinop [GS11, GS12], and Barak, Raghavendra, and Steurer [BRS11] developed an alternative approach to the design of approximation algorithms for graphs of bounded threshold-rank, based on semidefinite programming relaxations in the Lassere hierarchy and on novel rounding techniques. These algorithms are faster than the ones based on subspace enumeration and work on a broad class of problems. In this paper we develop a third approach to the design of such algorithms. We show, constructively, that graphs of bounded threshold-rank satisfy a weak Szemeredi regularity lemma analogous to the one proved by Frieze and Kannan [FK99] for dense graphs. The existence of efficient approximation algorithms is then a consequence of the regularity lemma, as shown by Frieze and Kannan. Applying our method to the Max Cut problem, we devise an algorithm that is faster than all previous algorithms, and is easier to describe and analyze. &copy; 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract:The development cost of safety-critical embedded systems is dominated today by the cost of software including verification and validation. This cost is typically related to the complexity of the software functions implementing the desired system behavior in nominal and off-nominal conditions. A widely used measure of complexity is the cyclomatic number, which is computed on the implementation code. However this technique is not effective when model-based development and code generation are used because the complexity of the software also depends on the communication and execution semantics of the models. This paper proposes a model-based complexity number that is defined on the decision diagram (DD) representation of the system functionality. The proposed complexity number gives an upper bound on the number of tests that are necessary to achieve Condition/Decision (C/D) coverage (which is required for safety critical systems). We show that the number of tests is related to the min-flow/max-cut computed on the DD. By comparing the proposed metric with the cyclomatic complexity, we show that the former seems to be better suited for capturing the complexity of the model than the latter. A case study on an aircraft power system shows that the complexity metric has applications in functional partitioning and architecture selection.

Abstract:Due to the limited number of orthogonal channels in a multi-radio multi-channel wireless mesh network (MR-WMN), overlapping channel assignment (CA) is one of the main factors that greatly affect the network capacity. In this paper, we first propose a model for measuring achieved network capacity in MR-WMNs. Then we prove that finding an optimal overlapping CA in a given MR-WMN with odd number of channels, is equivalent to finding an optimal assignment by only using its orthogonal channels. This theory allows us to use fewer channels to solve complicated CA problems. Third, we prove that in 802.11b/g-based MR-WMN, the simplified optimization problem is a Max-3-Cut problem. Although this problem is NP-hard, it has an efficient approximation algorithm that achieves approximation ratio of 1.19616 probabilistically by using the algorithm for Max-Cut whose approximation ratio is 1.1383 probabilistically. Based on the algorithm for Max-Cut, this paper proposes Max-Cut-based channel assignment (MCCA) which uses a heuristic method to adjust the result produced by the Max-Cut algorithm to achieve an even better result. Finally, we perform extensive simulations to compare the MCCA with a state-of-the-art Tabu-Search based algorithm. The results show that the Max-Cut-based overlapping CA algorithm effectively improves on the network capacity. &copy; 2013 IEEE.

Abstract:In this paper, we investigate the Max-Cut problem and propose a probabilistic heuristic to address its classic and weighted version. Our approach is based on the Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) that creates a population of individuals capable of evolving at each generation towards the global solution. We have applied the Max-Cut problem for image segmentation and defined the edges' weights as a modified function of the L2 norm between the RGB values of nodes. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a heuristic for Max-Cut and additionally to investigate how it can be applied in the segmentation context. &copy; 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract:Genepool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithms (GOMEAs) were recently proposed as a new way of designing linkage-friendly, efficiently-scalable evolutionary algorithms (EAs). GOMEAs combine the building of linkage models with an intensive, greedy mixing procedure. Recent results indicate that the use of hierarchical linkage models in GOMEAs lead to the most robust and efficient performance. Two of such GOMEA instances are the Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA) and the Multi-scale Linkage Neighbors Genetic Algorithm (MLNGA). The linkage models in these GOMEAs have their individual merits and drawbacks. In this paper, we propose enhancement techniques targeted at filtering out superfluous linkage sets from hierarchical linkage models and we consider a way to construct a linkage model that combines the strengths of different linkage models. We then propose a new GOMEA instance, called the Linkage Trees and Neighbors Genetic Algorithm (LTNGA), that combines the models of LTGA and MLNGA. LTNGA performs comparable or better than the best of either LTGA or MLNGA on various problems, including typical linkage benchmark problems and instances of the well-known combinatorial problem MAXCUT, especially when the proposed filtering techniques are used.

We propose a method to reformulate the facility location problem using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) and solve the QUBO model with off-shelf software. The analysis of the solutions produced by QUBO along with comparisons made with the linear model highlights both the attractiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. &copy; 2013 IEEE.

Abstract:In this paper, a cross-modal approach is developed for social image clustering and tag cleansing. First, a semantic image clustering algorithm is developed for assigning large-scale weakly-tagged social images into a large number of image topics of interest. Spam tags are detected automatically via sentiment analysis and multiple synonymous tags are merged as one super-topic according to their inter-topic semantic similarity contexts. Second, multiple base kernels are seamlessly combined by maximizing the correlations between the visual similarity contexts and the semantic similarity context, which can achieve more precise characterization of cross-modal (semantic and visual) similarity contexts among weakly-tagged social images. Finally, a K-way min-max cut algorithm is developed for social image clustering by minimizing the cumulative inter-cluster cross-modal similarity contexts while maximizing the cumulative intra-cluster cross-modal similarity contexts. The optimal weights for base kernel combination are simultaneously determined by minimizing the cumulative within-cluster variances. The polysemous tags and their ambiguous images are further split into multiple sub-topics for reducing their within-topic visual diversity. Our experiments on large-scale weakly-tagged Flickr images have provided very positive results. &copy; 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract:Let &Gamma; be a set of rational-valued functions on a fixed finite domain; such a set is called a finite-valued constraint language. The valued constraint satisfaction problem, VCSP(&Gamma;), is the problem of minimising a function given as a sum of functions from &Gamma;. We establish a dichotomy theorem with respect to exact solvability for all finite-valued languages defined on domains of arbitrary finite size. We show that every core language &Gamma; either admits a binary idempotent and symmetric fractional polymorphism in which case the basic linear programming relaxation solves any instance of VCSP(&Gamma;) exactly, or &Gamma; satisfies a simple hardness condition that allows for a polynomial-time reduction from Max-Cut to VCSP(&Gamma;). In other words, there is a single algorithm for all tractable cases and a single reason for intractability. Our results show that for exact solvability of VCSPs the basic linear programming relaxation suffices and semidefinite relaxations do not add any power. Our results generalise all previous partial classifications of finite-valued languages: the classification of {0, 1}-valued languages containing all unary functions obtained by Deineko et al. [JACM'06]; the classifications of {0, 1}-valued languages on two-element, three-element, and four-element domains obtained by Creignou [JCSS'95], Jonsson et al. [SICOMP'06], and Jonsson et al. [CP'11], respectively; the classifications of finite-valued languages on two-element and three-element domains obtained by Cohen et al. [AIJ'06] and Huber et al. [SODA'13], respectively; the classification of finite-valued languages containing all {0, 1}-valued unary functions obtained by Kolmogorov and &caron;Zivn&acute;y [JACM'13]; and the classification of Min-0-Ext problems obtained by Hirai [SODA'13].

Abstract:The Majority is Stablest Theorem has numerous applications in hardness of approximation and social choice theory. We give a new proof of the Majority is Stablest Theorem by induction on the dimension of the discrete cube. Unlike the previous proof, it uses neither the "invariance principle" nor Borell's result in Gaussian space. The new proof is general enough to include all previous variants of majority is stablest such as "it ain't over until it's over" and "Majority is most predictable". Moreover, the new proof allows us to derive a proof of Majority is Stablest in a constant level of the Sum of Squares hierarchy. This implies in particular that Khot-Vishnoi instance of Max-Cut does not provide a gap instance for the Lasserre hierarchy. Copyright 2013 ACM.

Abstract:We give a 2-approximation algorithm for Non-Uniform Sparsest Cut that runs in time n<sup>O(k)</sup>, where k is the treewidth of the graph. This improves on the previous 22 k-approximation in time poly(n) 2<sup>O(k)</sup> due to Chlamta&acute;&caron;c et al. [18]. To complement this algorithm, we show the following hardness results: If the Non-Uniform Sparsest Cut problem has a &rho;-approximation for series-parallel graphs (where &rho; &ge; 1), then the MAXCUT problem has an algorithm with approximation factor arbitrarily close to 1/&rho;. Hence, even for such restricted graphs (which have treewidth 2), the Sparsest Cut problem is NP-hard to approximate better than 17/16-&Epsilon; for &Epsilon;&gt; 0; assuming the Unique Games Conjecture the hardness becomes 1/&alpha;GW - &Epsilon;. For graphs with large (but constant) treewidth, we show a hardness result of 2 - &Epsilon; assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. Our algorithm rounds a linear program based on (a subset of) the Sherali-Adams lift of the standard Sparsest Cut LP. We show that even for treewidth-2 graphs, the LP has an integrality gap close to 2 even after polynomially many rounds of Sherali-Adams. Hence our approach cannot be improved even on such restricted graphs without using a stronger relaxation. Copyright 2013 ACM.

Abstract:We study a weaker formulation of the nullspace property which guarantees recovery of sparse signals from linear measurements by '1 minimization. We require this condition to hold only with high probability, given a distribution on the nullspace of the coding matrix A. Under some assumptions on the distribution of the reconstruction error, we show that testing these weak conditions means bounding the optimal value of two classical graph partitioning problems: the k-Dense-Subgraph and MaxCut problems. Both problems admit efficient, relatively tight relaxations, and we use a randomization argument to produce new approximation bounds for k-Dense-Subgraph. We test the performance of our results on several families of coding matrices. &copy; 2013 INFORMS.

Abstract:Given an undirected graph G=(V,E) with weights on the edges, the max-bisection problem (MBP) is to find a partition of the vertex set V into two subsets V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> of equal cardinality such that the sum of the weights of the edges crossing V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> is maximized. Relaxing the equal cardinality, constraint leads to the max-cut problem (MCP). In this work, we present a memetic algorithm for MBP which integrates a grouping crossover operator and a tabu search optimization procedure. The proposed crossover operator preserves the largest common vertex groupings with respect to the parent solutions while controlling the distance between the offspring solution and its parents. Extensive experimental studies on 71 well-known G-set benchmark instances demonstrate that our memetic algorithm improves, in many cases, the current best known solutions for both MBP and MCP.

Abstract:Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods play an increasingly important role in practical machine learning systems, particularly in agnostic settings when no parametric information or other prior knowledge is available about the data distribution. Given the constructed graph represented by a weight matrix, transductive inference is used to propagate known labels to predict the values of all unlabeled vertices. Designing a robust label diffusion algorithm for such graphs is a widely studied problem and various methods have recently been suggested. Many of these can be formalized as regularized function estimation through the minimization of a quadratic cost. However, most existing label diffusion methods minimize a univariate cost with the classification function as the only variable of interest. Since the observed labels seed the diffusion process, such univariate frameworks are extremely sensitive to the initial label choice and any label noise. To alleviate the dependency on the initial observed labels, this article proposes a bivariate formulation for graph-based SSL, where both the binary label information and a continuous classification function are arguments of the optimization. This bivariate formulation is shown to be equivalent to a linearly constrained Max-Cut problem. Finally an efficient solution via greedy gradient Max-Cut (GGMC) is derived which gradually assigns unlabeled vertices to each class with minimum connectivity. Once convergence guarantees are established, this greedy Max-Cut based SSL is applied on both artificial and standard benchmark data sets where it obtains superior classification accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art SSL methods. Moreover, GGMC shows robustness with respect to the graph construction method and maintains high accuracy over extensive experiments with various edge linking and weighting schemes. &copy; 2013 Jun Wang, Tony Jebara and Shih-Fu Chang.

Abstract:This work is concerned with the proof-complexity of certifying that optimization problems do not have good solutions. Specifically we consider bounded-degree "Sum of Squares" (SOS) proofs, a powerful algebraic proof system introduced in 1999 by Grigoriev and Vorobjov. Work of Shor, Lasserre, and Parrilo shows that this proof is automatizable using semidefinite programming (SDP), meaning that any n-variable degree-d proof can be found in time n<sup>O(d)</sup>. Furthermore, the SDP is dual to the well-known Lasserre SDP hierarchy, meaning that the "d/2-round Lasserre value" of an optimization problem is equal to the best bound provable using a degree-d SOS proof. These ideas were exploited in a recent paper by Barak et al. (STOC 2012) which shows that the known "hard instances" for the Unique-Games problem are in fact optimally solved by a constant level of the Lasserre SDP hierarchy. We continue the study of the power of SOS proofs in the context of difficult optimization problems. In particular, we show that the Balanced-Separator integrality gap instances proposed by Devanur et al. can have their optimal value certified by a degree-4 SOS proof. The key ingredient is an SOS proof of the KKL Theorem. We also investigate the extent to which the Khot-Vishnoi Max-Cut integrality gap instances can have their optimum value certified by an SOS proof. We show they can be certified to within a factor .952 (&gt; .878) using a constant-degree proof. These investigations also raise an interesting mathematical question: is there a constant-degree SOS proof of the Central Limit Theorem? Copyright &copy; SIAM.

Abstract:An instance of the (finite-)Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problem (VCSP) is given by a finite set of variables, a finite domain of values, and a sum of (rational-valued) functions, each function depending on a subset of the variables. The goal is to find an assignment of values to the variables that minimises the sum. We study (assuming that PTIME &ne; NP) how the complexity of this very general problem depends on the functions allowed in the instances. The case when the variables can take only two values was classified by Cohen et al.: essentially, submodular functions give rise to the only tractable case, and any non-submodular function can be used to express, in a certain specific sense, the NP-hard Max Cut problem. We investigate the case when the variables can take three values. We identify a new infinite family of conditions that includes bisubmodularity as a special case and which can collectively be called skew bisubmodularity. By a recent result of Thapper and Z&caron;ivny&acute;, this condition implies that the corresponding VCSP can be solved by linear programming. We prove that submodularity with respect to a total order and skew bisubmodularity give rise to the only tractable cases, and, in all other cases, again, Max Cut can be expressed. We also show that our characterisation of tractable cases is tight, that is, none of the conditions can be omitted. Thus, our results provide a new dichotomy theorem in constraint satisfaction research, and lead to a whole series of intriguing open problems in submodularity research. Copyright &copy; SIAM.

Abstract:Recently Raghavendra and Tan (SODA 2012) gave a 0.85-approximation algorithm for the MAX BISECTION problem. We improve their algorithm to a 0.8776-approximation. As MAX BISECTION is hard to approximate within &alpha;<inf>GW</inf> + &isin; &asyum; 0.8786 under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC), our algorithm is nearly optimal. We conjecture that MAX BISECTION is approximable within &alpha;<inf>GW</inf> -&isin;, i.e., the bisection constraint (essentially) does not make MAX CUT harder. We also obtain an optimal algorithm (assuming the UGC) for the analogous variant of MAX 2-SAT. Our approximation ratio for this problem exactly matches the optimal approximation ratio for MAX 2-SAT, i.e., &alpha;<inf>LLZ</inf> + &isin; &asyum; 0.9401, showing that the bisection constraint does not make MAX 2-SAT harder. This improves on a 0.93-approximation for this problem due to Raghavendra and Tan. Copyright &copy; SIAM.

Abstract:Given an undirected graph G=(V,E) where each edge of E is weighted with an integer number, the maximum cut problem (Max-Cut) is to partition the vertices of V into two disjoint subsets so as to maximize the total weight of the edges between the two subsets. As one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems, Max-Cut has attracted considerable attention over the last decades. In this paper, we present Breakout Local Search (BLS) for Max-Cut. BLS explores the search space by a joint use of local search and adaptive perturbation strategies. The proposed algorithm shows excellent performance on the set of well-known maximum cut benchmark instances in terms of both solution quality and computational time. Out of the 71 benchmark instances, BLS is capable of finding new improved results in 34 cases and attaining the previous best-known result for 35 instances, within computing times ranging from less than 1s to 5.6h for the largest instance with 20,000 vertices.

Abstract:Recently, a resolution-based transformation has been introduced for the usual Max-SAT encoding of several graph problems such as the Minimum Vertex Covering, Maximum Clique and Combinatorial Auctions which consists in iteratively applying specific inference rules to transform and simplify the original formula. Such transformation was shown suitable to improve the performance of local and systematic search procedures. In this paper, we present several refinements for such transformation. In particular, we introduce a more suitable transformation for the Minimum Vertex Covering problem, specially for its weighted version, and we extend its use for the Maximum Cut problem. Empirical results indicate that systematic Max-SAT solvers improve substantially their performance. &copy; 2012 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract:The unconstrained binary quadratic minimization problem is known to be NP-hard and due to its computational challenge and application capability, it becomes more and more considered and involved by the recent research studies, including both exact and heuristic solution approaches. Our work is in line with what was suggested by Glover et al. (in Eur. J. Oper. Res. 137, 272-287, 2002) who proposed one pass heuristics as alternatives to the well-known Devour Digest Tidy-up procedure (DDT) of Boros et al. (in RRR 39-89, 1989). The "devour" step sets a term of the current representation to 0 or 1, and the "tidy-up" step substitutes the logical consequences derived from the "digest" step into the current quadratic function. We propose several versions of the DDT constructive heuristic based on the alternative representation of the quadratic function. We also present an efficient implementation of local search using one-flip and two-flip moves that simultaneously change the values of one or two binary variables. Computational experiments performed on instances up to 7000 variables show the efficiency of our implementation in terms of quality improvement and CPU use enhancement. &copy; 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Abstract:This paper introduces the variable objective search framework for combinatorial optimization. The method utilizes different objective functions used in alternative mathematical programming formulations of the same combinatorial optimization problem in an attempt to improve the solutions obtained using each of these formulations individually. The proposed technique is illustrated using alternative quadratic unconstrained binary formulations of the classical maximum independent set problem in graphs. &copy; 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Abstract:We propose a backbone-guided tabu search (BGTS) algorithm for the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming (UBQP) problem that alternates between two phases: (1) a basic tabu search procedure to optimize the objective function as far as possible; (2) a strategy using the TS notion of strongly determined variables to alternately fix and free backbone components of the solutions which are estimated likely to share values in common with an optimal solution. Experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of finding the best-known solutions for 21 large random instances with 3000 to 7000 variables and boosts the performance of the basic TS in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. &copy; 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Abstract:This paper presents a canonical dual approach for finding either an optimal or approximate solution to the maximum cut problem (MAX CUT). We show that, by introducing a linear perturbation term to the objective function, the maximum cut problem is perturbed to have a dual problem which is a concave maximization problem over a convex feasible domain under certain conditions. Consequently, some global optimality conditions are derived for finding an optimal or approximate solution. A gradient decent algorithm is proposed for this purpose and computational examples are provided to illustrate the proposed approach. &copy; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2012.

Abstract:The roof dual bound for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization is the basis for several methods for efficiently computing the solution to many hard combinatorial problems. It works by constructing the tightest possible lower-bounding submodular function, and instead of minimizing the original objective function, the relaxation is minimized. However, for higher-order problems the technique has been less successful. A standard technique is to first reduce the problem into a quadratic one by introducing auxiliary variables and then apply the quadratic roof dual bound, but this may lead to loose bounds. We generalize the roof duality technique to higher-order optimization problems. Similarly to the quadratic case, optimal relaxations are defined to be the ones that give the maximum lower bound. We show how submodular relaxations can efficiently be constructed in order to compute the generalized roof dual bound for general cubic and quartic pseudo-boolean functions. Further, we prove that important properties such as persistency still hold, which allows us to determine optimal values for some of the variables. From a practical point of view, we experimentally demonstrate that the technique outperforms the state of the art for a wide range of applications, both in terms of lower bounds and in the number of assigned variables. &copy; 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:We study max-cut in classes of graphs defined by forbidding finitely many graphs as subgraphs, or a single graph as an induced subgraph or a minor. For the first two containment relations, we prove dichotomy theorems. For the minor order, we show how to solve max-cut in polynomial time for the class obtained by forbidding a graph with a single crossing (this generalizes a known result for K5-minor-free graphs) and identify an open problem which is the missing case for a dichotomy theorem. &copy; 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Quadratic Programming (QP) is the well-studied problem of maximizing over {-1,1} values the quadratic form &sum;<inf>i&ne;j</inf> a<inf>ij</inf> x <inf>i</inf> x<inf>j</inf>. QP captures many known combinatorial optimization problems, and assuming the Unique Games conjecture, Semidefinite Programming (SDP) techniques give optimal approximation algorithms. We extend this body of work by initiating the study of Quadratic Programming problems where the variables take values in the domain {-1,0,1}. The specific problem we study is (Formula Presented) This is a natural relative of several well studied problems (in fact Trevisan introduced a normalized variant as a stepping stone towards a spectral algorithm for Max Cut Gain). Quadratic ratio problems are good testbeds for both algorithms and complexity because the techniques used for quadratic problems for the {-1,1} and {0,1} domains do not seem to carry over to the {-1,0,1} domain. We give approximation algorithms and evidence for the hardness of approximating these problems. We consider an SDP relaxation obtained by adding constraints to the natural eigenvalue (or SDP) relaxation for this problem. Using this, we obtain an O&tilde;(n<sup>1/3</sup>) approximation algorithm for QP-ratio. We also give a approximation for bipartite graphs, and better algorithms for special cases. As with other problems with ratio objectives (e.g. uniform sparsest cut), it seems difficult to obtain inapproximability results based on P &ne; NP. We give two results that indicate that QP-Ratio is hard to approximate to within any constant factor: one is based on the assumption that random instances of Max k-AND are hard to approximate, and the other makes a connection to a ratio version of Unique Games. We also give a natural distribution on instances of QP-Ratio for which an n <sup>&Epsilon;</sup> approximation (for &Epsilon; roughly 1/10) seems out of reach of current techniques. &copy; 2012 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract:We study the boundary of tractability for the Max-Cut problem in graphs. Our main result shows that Max-Cut above the Edwards-Erdo{combining double acute accent}s bound is fixed-parameter tractable: we give an algorithm that for any connected graph with n vertices and m edges finds a cut of size m/2 + n-1/4 + k in time 2<sup>O(k)</sup>&middotn<sup>4</sup>, or decides that no such cut exists. This answers a long-standing open question from parameterized complexity that has been posed a number of times over the past 15 years. Our algorithm is asymptotically optimal, under the Exponential Time Hypothesis, and is strengthened by a polynomial-time computable kernel of polynomial size. &copy; 2012 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract:Most of previous genetic algorithms for solving graph problems have used a vertex-based encoding. We proposed an edge encoding based new genetic algorithm using a spanning tree. Contrary to general edge-based encoding, a spanning tree-based encoding represents only feasible partitions. As a target problem, we adopted the MAX CUT problem, which is well known as a representative NP-hard problem, and examined the performance of the proposed genetic algorithm. The experiments on benchmark graphs are executed and compared with vertex-based encoding. Performance improvements of the spanning tree-based encoding on sparse graphs was observed. &copy; ICROS 2012.

Abstract:Finding edge-disjoint odd cycles is one of the most important problems in graph theory, graph algorithm and combinatorial optimization. In fact, it is closely related to the well-known max-cut problem. One of the difficulties of this problem is that the Erdos-Po&acute;sa property does not hold for odd cycles in general. Motivated by this fact, we prove that for any positive integer k, there exists an integer f(k) satisfying the following: For any 4-edge-connected graph G = (V,E), either G has edge-disjoint k odd cycles or there exists an edge set F &sube; E with |F| &le f(k) such that G - F is bipartite. We note that the 4-edge-connectivity is best possible in this statement. Similar approach can be applied to an algorithmic question. Suppose that the input graph G is a 4-edge-connected graph with n vertices. We show that, for any &Epsilon; &gt; 0, if k = O((logloglogn)<sup>1/2-&Epsilon;</sup>), then the edge-disjoint k odd cycle packing in G can be solved in polynomial time of n. &copy; Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi and Yusuke Kobayashi.

Abstract:Poljak and Turzi&acute;k (Discrete Math. 1986) introduced the notion of &lambda;-extendible properties of graphs as a generalization of the property of being bipartite. They showed that for any 0 &lt; &lambda; &lt; 1 and &lambda;-extendible property &pi;, any connected graph G on n vertices and m edges contains a spanning subgraph H &isin; &pi; with at least &lambda;m +1-&lambda;/2 (n - 1) edges. The property of being bipartite is &lambda;-extendible for &lambda; = 1/2, and thus the Poljak-Turzi&acute;k bound generalizes the well-known Edwards-Erdos bound for MAX-CUT. We define a variant, namely strong &lambda;-extendibility, to which the Poljak-Turzi&acute;k bound applies. For a strongly &lambda;-extendible graph property &pi;, we define the parameterized ABOVE POLJAK-TURZI&acute;K (&pi;) problem as follows: Given a connected graph G on n vertices and m edges and an integer parameter k, does there exist a spanning subgraph H of G such that H &isin; &pi; and H has at least &lambda;m +1-&lambda;/2 (n - 1) + k edges? The parameter is k, the surplus over the number of edges guaranteed by the Poljak-Turzi&acute;k bound. We consider properties &pi; for which the ABOVE POLJAK-TURZI&acute;K (&pi;) problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) on graphs which are O(k) vertices away from being a graph in which each block is a clique. We show that for all such properties, ABOVE POLJAK-TURZI&acute;K (&pi;) is FPT for all 0 &lt; &lambda; &lt; 1. Our results hold for properties of oriented graphs and graphs with edge labels. Our results generalize the recent result of Crowston et al. (ICALP 2012) on MAX-CUT parameterized above the Edwards-Erdos bound, and yield FPT algorithms for several graph problems parameterized above lower bounds. For instance, we get that the above-guarantee MAX q-COLORABLE SUBGRAPH problem is FPT. Our results also imply that the parameterized above-guarantee ORIENTED MAX ACYCLIC DIGRAPH problem is FPT, thus solving an open question of Raman and Saurabh (Theor. Comput. Sci. 2006). &copy; M.

Abstract:We determine the complexity of computing pure Nash equilibria in restricted network congestion games. Restricted network congestion games are network congestion games, where for each player there exits a set of edges which he is not allowed to use. Rosenthal's potential function guarantees the existence of a Nash Equilibrium. We show that computing a Nash equilibrium in a restricted network congestion game with two players is <i>PLS</i>-complete, using a tight reduction from MAXCUT. The result holds for directed networks and for undirected networks.

Abstract:Min-max cut(Mcut) algorithm completely satisfies the general criterion of the cluster algorithms, so Mcut has good grouping performance. However, in the actual solution, the objective function of Mcut usually is relaxed into the objective function of Normalized cut(Ncut). It does not make full use of the clustering performance of Mcut. In order to overcome this problem, this paper presents an improved Mcut algorithm(SMcut) that uses subspace technology. In order to improve SMcut's speed in image segmentation, a SMcut based on block(BSMcut) is proposed. Experimental result shows that SMcut and BSMcut has better segmentation performance, at the same time, BSMcut can reduce the computational complexity.

Abstract:This paper presents two path relinking algorithms to solve the unconstrained binary quadratic programming (UBQP) problem. One is based on a greedy strategy to generate the relinking path from the initial solution to the guiding solution and the other operates in a random way. We show extensive computational results on five sets of benchmarks, including 31 large random UBQP instances and 103 structured instances derived from the MaxCut problem. Comparisons with several state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. It is noteworthy that both algorithms are able to improve the previous best known results for almost 40 percent of the 103 MaxCut instances. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:We introduce the notion of a stable instance for a discrete optimization problem, and argue that in many practical situations only sufficiently stable instances are of interest. The question then arises whether stable instances of NP-hard problems are easier to solve, and in particular, whether there exist algorithms that solve in polynomial time all sufficiently stable instances of some NP-hard problem. The paper focuses on the Max-Cut problem, for which we show that this is indeed the case.

Abstract:The EDF connecting the product's design information and its energy characteristics was difficult to convert to design parameters and control measures, which was coupled with large amount of design elements. Aiming to solve this problem, the decoupling mechanism of EDF was built. The decoupling mechanism was constituted by analyzing coupling characteristics, constructing coupling element relation matrix(CERM), evaluating design priority of coupled element and gaining energy design parameters and optimum value (or control measures and target). In addition, the max cut width b<sub>Dim</sub> of NC machines was selected as an illustrative example to show the decoupling mechanism of EDF.

Abstract:We discuss the optimal allocation problem in combinatorial auctions, where the items are allocated to bidders so that the sum of the bidders' utilities is maximized In this paper, we consider the case where utility functions are given by quadratic functions; the class of such utility functions has a succinct representation but is sufficiently general. The main aim of this paper is to show the computational complexity of the optimal allocation problem with quadratic utility functions. We consider the cases where utility functions are submodular and supermodular, and show NP-hardness and/or polynomial-time exact/approximation algorithms. These results are given by using the relationship with graph cut problems such as the min/max cut problem and the multiway cut problem.

Abstract:We describe a new approximation algorithm for Max Cut. Our algorithm runs in O&tilde;(n<sup>2</sup>) time, where n is the number of vertices, and achieves an approximation ratio of .531. In instances in which an optimal solution cuts a 1 - &epsiv; fraction of edges, our algorithm finds a solution that cuts a 1-4&radic;&epsiv;+8&epsiv;-o(1) fraction of edges. Our main result is a variant of spectral partitioning, which can be implemented in nearly linear time. Given a graph in which the Max Cut optimum is a 1 - &epsiv; fraction of edges, our spectral partitioning algorithm finds a set S of vertices and a bipartition L, R = S - L of S such that at least a 1 - O(&radic;&epsiv;) fraction of the edges incident on S have one endpoint in L and one endpoint in R. (This can be seen as an analogue of Cheeger's inequality for the smallest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a graph.) Iterating this procedure yields the approximation results stated above. A different, more complicated, variant of spectral partitioning leads to a polynomial time algorithm that cuts a 1/2 + e<sup>-&Omega;(1/&epsiv;)</sup> fraction of edges in graphs in which the optimum is 1/2 + &epsiv;.

Abstract:The max-cut problem is a classical NP-hard problem in graph theory. In this paper, we adopt a local search method, called <i>MCFM</i>, which is a simple modification of the Fiduccia-Mattheyses heuristic method in Fiduccia and Mattheyses (Proc. ACM/IEEE DAC, pp. 175-181, 1982) for the circuit partitioning problem in very large scale integration of circuits and systems. The method uses much less computational cost than general local search methods. Then, an auxiliary function is presented which has the same global maximizers as the max-cut problem. We show that maximization of the function using <i>MCFM</i> can escape successfully from previously converged discrete local maximizers by taking increasing values of a parameter. An algorithm is proposed for the max-cut problem, by maximizing the auxiliary function using <i>MCFM</i> from random initial solutions. Computational experiments were conducted on three sets of standard test instances from the literature. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective for the three sets of standard test instances.

Abstract:The global optimization method based on discrete filled function is a new method that solves large scale max-cut problems. We first define a new discrete filled function based on the structure of the max-cut problem and analyze its properties. Unlike the continuous filled function methods, by the characteristic of the max-cut problem, the parameters in the proposed filled function does not need to be adjusted. By combining a procedure that randomly generates initial points for minimization of the proposed filled function, the proposed algorithm can greatly reduce the computational time and be applied to large scale max-cut problems. Numerical results and comparisons with several heuristic methods indicate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and stable to obtain high quality solution of large scale max-cut problems.

Abstract:The class of two-spin systems contains several important models, including random independent sets and the Ising model of statistical physics. We show that for both the hard-core (independent set) model and the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model with arbitrary external field, it is NP-hard to approximate the partition function or approximately sample from the model on regular graphs when the model has non-uniqueness on the corresponding regular tree. Together with results of Jerrum - Sinclair, Weitz, and Sinclair - Srivastava - Thurley giving FPRAS's for all other two-spin systems except at the uniqueness threshold, this gives an almost complete classification of the computational complexity of two-spin systems on bounded-degree graphs. Our proof establishes that the normalized log-partition function of any two-spin system on bipartite locally tree-like graphs converges to a limiting "free energy density" which coincides with the (non-rigorous) Be the prediction of statistical physics. We use this result to characterize the local structure of two-spin systems on locally tree-like bipartite expander graphs, which then become the basic gadgets in a randomized reduction to approximate MAX-CUT. Our approach is novel in that it makes no use of the second moment method employed in previous works on these questions. &copy; 2012 IEEE.

Abstract:We consider the Unconstrained Submodular Maximization problem in which we are given a non-negative submodular function f : 2<sup>N</sup> &rarr; &Ropf;<sup>+</sup>, and the objective is to find a subset S &sube; N maximizing f(S). This is one of the most basic submodular optimization problems, having a wide range of applications. Some well known problems captured by Unconstrained Submodular Maximization include MaxCut, Max-DiCut, and variants of Max-SAT and maximum facility location. We present a simple randomized linear time algorithm achieving a tight approximation guarantee of 1/2, thus matching the known hardness result of Feige et al. [11]. Our algorithm is based on an adaptation of the greedy approach which exploits certain symmetry properties of the problem. Our method might seem counterintuitive, since it is known that the greedy algorithm fails to achieve any bounded approximation factor for the problem.

Abstract:Phylogenetic tree reconstruction is a fundamental biological problem. Quartet amalgamation-combining a set of trees over four taxa into a tree over the full set of taxa-stands at the core of many phylogenetic reconstruction methods. This task has attracted many theoretical as well as practical works. However, even reconstruction from a consistent set of quartet trees is NP-hard, and the best approximation ratio known is 1/3. Despite its importance, the only rigorous results for approximating quartets are the naive 1/3 approximation that applies to the general case and a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) when the input is the complete set of all (n4) possible quartets. Even when it is possible to determine the correct quartet induced by every four taxa, the time needed to generate the complete set of all quartets may be impractical. A faster approach is to sample at random just m (n4) quartets and provide this sample as an input. In this work we present the first polynomial time approximation algorithm whose expected guaranteed approximation is strictly better than 1/3 when the input is any random sample of m consistent quartets. The approximation ratio of the algorithm is greater than 0.425. An important ingredient in our algorithm involves solving a weighted maximum cut problem in a certain weighted graph that corresponds to the set of input quartets. Our second main result generalizes the aforementioned PTAS algorithm to handle dense, rather than complete, inputs. Copyright &copy; by SIAM.

Abstract:In this paper we study the performance of the quantum adiabatic algorithm on random instances of two combinatorial optimization problems, 3-regular 3-XORSAT and 3-regular max-cut. The cost functions associated with these two clause-based optimization problems are similar as they are both defined on 3-regular hypergraphs. For 3-regular 3-XORSAT the clauses contain three variables and for 3-regular max-cut the clauses contain two variables. The quantum adiabatic algorithms we study for these two problems use interpolating Hamiltonians which are amenable to sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo and quantum cavity methods. Using these techniques we find that the quantum adiabatic algorithm fails to solve either of these problems efficiently, although for different reasons. &copy; 2012 American Physical Society.

Abstract:Many local search algorithms are based on searching in the k-exchange neighborhood. This is the set of solutions that can be obtained from the current solution by exchanging at most k elements. As a rule of thumb, the larger k is, the better are the chances of finding an improved solution. However, for inputs of size n, a nai&uml;ve brute-force search of the k-exchange neighborhood requires n<sup>O(k)</sup> time, which is not practical even for very small values of k. We show that for several classes of sparse graphs, including planar graphs, graphs of bounded vertex degree and graphs excluding some fixed graph as a minor, an improved solution in the k-exchange neighborhood for many problems can be found much more efficiently. Our algorithms run in time O(&tau;(k)&middot;n<sup>c</sup>), where &tau; is a function depending only on k and c is a constant independent of k and n. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach on a variety of problems including r-Center, Vertex Cover, Odd Cycle Transversal, Max-Cut, and Min-Bisection. In particular, on planar graphs, all our algorithms searching for a k-local improvement run in time O(2<sup>O(k)</sup>&middot;n<sup>2</sup>), which is polynomial for k=O(logn). We complement these fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for k-local search with parameterized intractability results indicating that brute-force search is unavoidable in more general classes of graphs.

Abstract:We prove exponential lower bounds on the running time of Dynamic Programs (DP) of a certain class for some Combinatorial Optimization Problems. The class of DPs for which we derive the lower bounds is general enough to include well-known DPs for Combinatorial Optimization Problems, such as the ones developed for the Shortest Path Problem, the Knapsack Problem, or the Traveling Salesman Problem. The problems analyzed include the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Bipartite Matching Problem (BMP), the Min and the Max Cut Problems (MCP), the Min Partition Problem (MPP), and the Min Cost Test Collection Problem (MCTCP). We draw a connection between Dynamic Programs and algorithms for polynomial evaluation. We then derive and use complexity results of polynomial evaluation to prove similar results for Dynamic Programs for the TSP or the BMP. We define a reduction between problems that allows us to generalize these bounds to problems for which either the TSP or the BMP transforms to. Moreover, we show that some standard transformations between problems are of this kind. In this fashion, we extend the lower bounds to other Combinatorial Optimization Problems.

Abstract:Multi parent crossover has been successfully applied to solve many combinatorial optimization problems such as unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem (UBQP). This because using more than two parents has increased the intensification process by exploiting the information shared by multi parents. However not all type of crossovers are suitable to solve vehicle routing problem (VRP). Therefore, this work introduces a multi parent insertion crossover in solving vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) by enhancing two parent insertion crossovers. This crossover exchange information among three parents instead of two. Result tested on Solomon VRPTW benchmarks demonstrate that multi parent crossover outperformed two parent crossover on same instances. This prove the effectiveness of having more parents for crossover that can be help the search to find better quality solution. &copy; 2012 IEEE.

Abstract:We consider the model introduced by Bilu and Linial [12], who study problems for which the optimal clustering does not change when distances are perturbed. They show that even when a problem is NP-hard, it is sometimes possible to obtain efficient algorithms for instances resilient to certain multiplicative perturbations, e.g. on the order of O(&radic;n) for max-cut clustering. Awasthi et al. [6] consider center-based objectives, and Balcan and Liang [9] analyze the k-median and min-sum objectives, giving efficient algorithms for instances resilient to certain constant multiplicative perturbations. Here, we are motivated by the question of to what extent these assumptions can be relaxed while allowing for efficient algorithms. We show there is little room to improve these results by giving NP-hardness lower bounds for both the k-median and min-sum objectives. On the other hand, we show that multiplicative resilience parameters, even only on the order of &Theta;(1), can be so strong as to make the clustering problem trivial, and we exploit these assumptions to present a simple one-pass streaming algorithm for the k-median objective. We also consider a model of additive perturbations and give a correspondence between additive and multiplicative notions of stability. Our results provide a close examination of the consequences of assuming, even constant, stability in data.

Abstract:&Epsilon;-support vector regression (&Epsilon;-SVR) is formulated as a constrained minimization problem. Based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker complementary condition in optimization theory, it can be converted into an unconstrained convex and non-smooth quadratic programming problem. Applying the smooth techniques, we propose a piecewise smooth function to approximate to the non-differentiable term of the object function of the programming problem and construct an unconstrained piecewise smooth support vector regression (PWSSVR) model. The global convergence of PWSSVR is proved by mathematical inductive method. Newton-Armijo algorithm is used to train the PWSSVR. Primary numerical results illustrate that our proposed approach improves the regression performance and the learning efficiency. &copy; 2012 Binary Information Press.

Abstract:The structural properties of graphs are usually characterized in terms of invariants, which are functions of graphs that do not depend on the labeling of the nodes. In this paper we study convex graph invariants, which are graph invariants that are convex functions of the adjacency matrix of a graph. Some examples include functions of a graph such as the maximum degree, the MAXCUT value (and its semidefinite relaxation), and spectral invariants such as the sum of the k largest eigenvalues. Such functions can be used to construct convex sets that impose various structural constraints on graphs, and thus provide a unified framework for solving a number of interesting graph problems via convex optimization. We give a representation of all convex graph invariants in terms of certain elementary invariants, and we describe methods to compute or approximate convex graph invariants tractably. We discuss the interesting subclass of spectral invariants, and also compare convex and non-convex invariants. Finally we use convex graph invariants to provide efficient convex programming solutions to graph problems such as the deconvolution of the composition of two graphs into the individual components, hypothesis testing between graph families, and the generation of graphs with certain desired structural properties. &copy; 2012 IEEE.

Abstract:We improve the running time of the general algorithmic technique known as Baker's approach (1994) [1] on H-minor-free graphs from O(n<sup>f(|H|)</sup>) to O(f(|H|)n<sup>O(1)</sup>). The numerous applications include, e.g. a 2-approximation for coloring and PTASes for various problems such as dominating set and max-cut, where we obtain similar improvements. On classes of odd-minor-free graphs, which have gained significant attention in recent time, we obtain a similar acceleration for a variant of the structural decomposition theorem proved by Demaine et al. (2010) [20]. We use these algorithms to derive faster 2-approximations; furthermore, we present the first PTASes and subexponential FPT-algorithms for independent set and vertex cover on these graph classes using a novel dynamic programming technique. We also introduce a technique to derive (nearly) subexponential parameterized algorithms on H-minor-free graphs. Our technique applies, in particular, to problems such as Steiner tree, (directed) subgraph with a property, (directed) longest path, and (connected/independent) dominating set, on some or all proper minor-closed graph classes. We obtain as a corollary that all problems with a minor-monotone subexponential kernel and amenable to our technique can be solved in subexponential FPT-time onH-minor free graphs. This results in a general methodology for subexponential parameterized algorithms outside the framework of bidimensionality. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:A fullerene graph is a cubic bridgeless plane graph with all faces of size 5 and 6. We show that every fullerene graph on n vertices can be made bipartite by deleting at most &radic;12n/5 edges and has an independent set with at least n/2-&radic;3n/5 vertices. Both bounds are sharp, and we characterize the extremal graphs. This proves conjectures of Dos&caron;lic&acute; and Vukic&caron;evic&acute; and of Daugherty. We deduce two further conjectures on the independence number of fullerene graphs, as well as a new upper bound on the smallest eigenvalue of a fullerene graph. &copy; 2012 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

Abstract:We present an improved algorithm for finding exact solutions to Max-Cut and the related binary quadratic programming problem, both classic problems of combinatorial optimization. The algorithm uses a branch-(and-cut-)and-bound paradigm, using standard valid inequalities and nonstandard semidefinite bounds. More specifically, we add a quadratic regularization term to the strengthened semidefinite relaxation in order to use a quasi-Newton method to compute the bounds. The ratio of the tightness of the bounds to the time required to compute them depends on two real parameters; we show how adjusting these parameters and the set of strengthening inequalities gives us a very efficient bounding procedure. Embedding our bounding procedure in a generic branch-and-bound platform, we get a competitive algorithm: extensive experiments show that our algorithm dominates the best existing method. &copy; 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and Mathematical Optimization Society.

Abstract:We consider low-rank semidefinite programming (LRSDP) relaxations of unconstrained \{-1,1\} quadratic problems (or, equivalently, of Max-Cut problems) that can be formulated as the non-convex nonlinear programming problem of minimizing a quadratic function subject to separable quadratic equality constraints. We prove the equivalence of the LRSDP problem with the unconstrained minimization of a new merit function and we define an efficient and globally convergent algorithm, called SpeeDP, for finding critical points of the LRSDP problem. We provide evidence of the effectiveness of SpeeDP by comparing it with other existing codes on an extended set of instances of the Max-Cut problem. We further include SpeeDP within a simply modified version of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm and we show that the corresponding heuristic SpeeDP-MC can generate high-quality cuts for very large, sparse graphs of size up to a million nodes in a few hours. &copy; 2012 Springer and Mathematical Optimization Society.

Abstract:We propose a non-convex training objective for robust binary classification of data sets in which label noise is present. The design is guided by the intention of solving the resulting problem by adiabatic quantum optimization. Two requirements are imposed by the engineering constraints of existing quantum hardware: training problems are formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization; and model parameters are represented as binary expansions of low bit-depth. In the present work we validate this approach by using a heuristic classical solver as a stand-in for quantum hardware. Testing on several popular data sets and comparing with a number of existing losses we find substantial advantages in robustness as measured by test error under increasing label noise. Robustness is enabled by the non-convexity of our hardware-compatible loss function, q-loss. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).

Abstract:The max-cut problem is to partition the vertices of a weighted graph G = (V,E) into two subsets such that the weight sum of the edges crossing the two subsets is maximized. This paper presents a memetic max-cut algorithm (MACUT) that relies on a dedicated multi-parent crossover operator and a perturbation-based tabu search procedure. Experiments on 30 G-set benchmark instances show that MACUT competes favorably with 6 state-of-the-art max-cut algorithms, and for 10 instances improves on the best known results ever reported in the literature. &copy; 2012 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract:Most of previous genetic algorithms for solving graph problems have used vertex-based encoding. In this paper, we introduce spanning tree-based encoding instead of vertex-based encoding for the well-known MAX CUT problem. We propose a new genetic algorithm based on this new type of encoding. We conducted experiments on benchmark graphs and could obtain performance improvement on sparse graphs, which appear in real-world applications such as social networks and systems biology, when the proposed methods are compared with ones using vertex-based encoding. &copy; 2012 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract:Global Equilibrium Search (GES) is a meta-heuristic framework that shares similar ideas with the simulated annealing method. GES accumulates a compact set of information about the search space to generate promising initial solutions for the techniques that require a starting solution, such as the simple local search method. GES has been successful for many classic discrete optimization problems: the unconstrained quadratic programming problem, the maximum satisfiability problem, the max-cut problem, the multidimensional knapsack problem and the job-shop scheduling problem. GES provides state-of-the-art performance on all of these domains when compared to the current best known algorithms from the literature. GES algorithm can be naturally extended for parallel computing as it performs search simultaneously in distinct areas of the solution space. In this talk, we provide an overview of Global Equilibrium Search and discuss some successful applications.

Abstract:Several NP-hard problems, like MAXIMUM INDEPENDENT SET, COLORING, and MAX-CUT are polynomial time solvable on bipartite graphs. An equivalent characterization of bipartite graphs is that it is the set of all graphs that do not contain any odd length cycle. Thus, a natural question here is what happens to the complexity of these problems if we know that the length of the longest odd cycle is bounded by <i>k</i>? Let O<sub>k</sub> denote the set of all graphs <i>G</i> such that the length of the longest odd cycle is upper bounded by <i>k</i>. Hsu, Ikura and Nemhauser [<i>Math. Programming</i>, 1981] studied the effect of avoiding long odd cycle for the MAXIMUM INDEPENDENT SET problem and showed that a maximum sized independent set on a graph G &isin; O<sub>k</sub> on <i>n</i> vertices can be found in time <i>n</i><sup>O(k)</sup>. Later, Gro&uml;tschel and Nemhauser [<i>Math. Programming</i>, 1984] did a similar study for MAX-CUT and obtained an algorithm with running time <i>n</i><sup>O(k)</sup> on a graph G &isin; O<sub>k</sub> on <i>n</i> vertices. In this paper, we revisit these problems together with <i>q</i>-COLORING and observe that all of these problems admit algorithms with running time <i>O</i>(<i>c</i><sup>k</sup><i>n</i><sup>O(1)</sup>) on a graph G &isin; O<sub>k</sub> on <i>n</i> vertices. Thus, showing that all these problems are fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by the length of the longest odd cycle of the input graph. However, following the recent trend in parameterized complexity, we also study the kernelization complexity of these problems. We show that MAXIMUM INDEPENDENT SET, <i>q</i>-COLORING for some fixed <i>q</i> &ges; 3 and MAX-CUT do not admit a polynomial kernel unless co-NP &sube; NP/poly, when parameterized by <i>k</i>, the length of the longest odd cycle.

Abstract:The max-cut problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem. This paper uses a Population Reinforced Optimization Based Exploration (PROBE) as a framework for developing metaheuristic algorithm for solving the max-cut problem. A solution is constructed by a greedy construction method, then a local search procedure, which is based on the Fiduccia and Mattheyses heuristic, is used to improve the solution. Experimental tests are done on some instances taken from the literature. The experiment results and comparisons show that the proposed algorithm is efficient for these tested benchmarks. &copy; 2012 IEEE.

Abstract:It has long been conjectured that the crossing numbers of the complete bipartite graph K<inf>m,n</inf> and of the complete graph K<inf>n</inf> equal Z(m, n) := &lfloor;n/2&rfloor; &lfloor;n-1/2&rfloor; &lfloor;m/2&rfloor; &lfloor;m-1/2&rfloor; and Z(n) := 1/4 &lfloor;n/2&rfloor; &lfloor;n-1/2&rfloor; &lfloor;n-2/2&rfloor; &lfloor;n-3/2&rfloor;, respectively. In a 2-page drawing of a graph, the vertices are drawn on a straight line (the spine), and each edge is contained in one of the half-planes of the spine. The 2-page crossing number &nu;<inf>2</inf>(G) of a graph G is the minimum number of crossings in a 2-page drawing of G. Somewhat surprisingly, there are 2-page drawings of K <inf>m,n</inf> (respectively, K<inf>n</inf>) with exactly Z(m, n) (respectively, Z(n)) crossings, thus yielding the conjectures (I) &nu;<inf>2</inf>(K <inf>m,n</inf>) ?= Z(m, n) and (II) &nu;<inf>2</inf>(K<inf>n</inf>) ?= Z(n). It is known that (I) holds for min{m, n} &le 6, and that (II) holds for n &le 14. In this paper we prove that (I) holds asymptotically (that is, lim <inf>n-&infin;</inf> &nu;<inf>2</inf>(K<inf>m,n</inf>)/Z(m, n) = 1) for m = 7 and 8. We also prove (II) for 15 &le n &le 18 and n &Epsilon; {20, 24}, and establish the asymptotic estimate lim<inf>n-&infin;</inf> &nu;<inf>2</inf>(Kn)/ Z(n) &ge; 0.9253. The previous best-known lower bound involved the constant 0.8594. &copy; 2012 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

Abstract:Laurent &amp; Poljak introduced a class of valid inequalities for the max-cut problem, called gap inequalities, which include many other known inequalities as special cases. The gap inequalities have received little attention and are poorly understood. This paper presents the first ever computational results. In particular, we describe heuristic separation algorithms for gap inequalities and their special cases, and show that an LP-based cutting-plane algorithm based on these separation heuristics can yield very good upper bounds in practice. &copy; 2012 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract:Minimization with orthogonality constraints (e.g., {Mathematical expression}) and/or spherical constraints (e.g., {Mathematical expression}) has wide applications in polynomial optimization, combinatorial optimization, eigenvalue problems, sparse PCA, p-harmonic flows, 1-bit compressive sensing, matrix rank minimization, etc. These problems are difficult because the constraints are not only non-convex but numerically expensive to preserve during iterations. To deal with these difficulties, we apply the Cayley transform-a Crank-Nicolson-like update scheme-to preserve the constraints and based on it, develop curvilinear search algorithms with lower flops compared to those based on projections and geodesics. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on a variety of test problems. In particular, for the maxcut problem, it exactly solves a decomposition formulation for the SDP relaxation. For polynomial optimization, nearest correlation matrix estimation and extreme eigenvalue problems, the proposed algorithms run very fast and return solutions no worse than those from their state-of-the-art algorithms. For the quadratic assignment problem, a gap 0.842&nbsp;% to the best known solution on the largest problem "tai256c" in QAPLIB can be reached in 5&nbsp;min on a typical laptop. &copy; 2012 Springer and Mathematical Optimization Society.

Abstract:A Tabu Search heuristic for unconstrained binary quadratic programming performs perfectly on a range of random problem instances. A genetic algorithm searches spaces of UBQP instances for instances that challenge the heuristic. The GA's evaluation step compares the performance of the Tabu Search to that of a memetic algorithm on the candidate instance being evaluated. On UBQP instances evolved by the GA, the TS heuristic returns solutions that are inferior to those of the memetic algorithm by significant margins. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).

Abstract:The linkage tree genetic algorithm (LTGA) learns, each generation, a linkage model by building a hierarchical cluster tree. The LTGA is an instance of the more general gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary algorithm (GOMEA) that uses a family of subsets (FOS) linkage model. We compare the performance of the linkage model learning LTGA with several predetermined FOS linkage models applied by GOMEA. The predetermined models are matched to the underlying problem structure of four benchmark functions: onemax, deceptive trap functions, maximal overlapping nearest-neighbor NK-landscapes, and weighted MAXCUT problems. Although the a priori fixed models are specifically designed to capture the interactions between the problem variables, experimental results show that - for problems with intricate interaction structure - they are actually less efficient than LTGA that dynamically learns a hierarchical tree model. Some of these observations were unexpected and raise the question of what exactly is the optimal linkage structure for a given problem as used by GOMEA. In the case of the NK-problem a linkage model that is an accurate description of the underlying additively decomposable fitness structure is clearly not an optimal linkage model. Being able to rebuild the linkage model each generation has clear benefits above using fixed, predetermined linkage models. &copy; 2012 ACM.

Abstract:The Max-Cut problem is a classical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It consists of dividing the vertices of a weighted graph into two subsets, such that the sum of the weights of the edges connecting the two subsets is maximized. Although semidefinite relaxation algorithms for Max-Cut have been proved to be of high quality and offer performance guarantees, in practice, metaheuristic algorithms are still the first option to solve large Max-Cut instances. In this paper, we present the first effort at combining semidefinite programming (SDP) with metaheuristic algorithm (Memetic Algorithm) to solve the Max-Cut problem. Based on the solution of semidefinite relaxation, we use Goemans-Williamson Algorithm to seed high quality solutions to the initial population for the memetic algorithm. Experimental results on well-known benchmark problems show that our new hybrid algorithm is capable of obtaining better solutions in the initial population generation stage than previous algorithms, and the overall performance of our algorithm is better than one of the best existing algorithms. Besides, new best solutions for 14 benchmark problems were found by our algorithm. &copy; 2012 ACM.

Abstract:Recently, the Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA) was introduced as one of the latest developments in a line of EA research that studies building models to capture and exploit linkage information between problem variables. LTGA was reported to exhibit excellent performance on several linkage benchmark problems, mainly attributed to use of the LT linkage model. In this paper we consider a technique called Forced Improvements (FI), that allows LTGA to converge to a single solution without requiring an explicit, diversity-reducing, selection step. We further consider a different linkage model, called Linkage Neighbors (LN), that is more flexible, yet can be learned equally efficiently from data. Even with the simplest learning approach for configuring the LN, better results are obtained on the linkage benchmark problems than when the LT model is used. However, on weighted MAXCUT (a combinatorial optimization problem), very poor results are obtained and a more involved multiscale LN variant is required to obtain a performance near that of LTGA. Our results underline the advantage of processing linkage in a single model on multiple scales as well as the importance of also considering problems other problems than common linkage benchmark problems when judging the merits of linkage learning techniques. &copy; 2012 ACM.

Abstract:We study the problem of matrix isomorphism of matrix Lie algebras (MatIsoLie). Lie algebras arise centrally in areas as diverse as differential equations, particle physics, group theory, and the Mulmuley -- Sohoni Geometric Complexity Theory program. A matrix Lie algebra is a set L of matrices that is closed under linear combinations and the operation [A, B] = AB - BA. Two matrix Lie algebras L, L' are matrix isomorphic if there is an invertible matrix M such that conjugating every matrix in L by M yields the set L'. We show that certain cases of MatIsoLie -- for the wide and widely studied classes of semi simple and abelian Lie algebras -- are equivalent to graph isomorphism and linear code equivalence, respectively. On the other hand, we give polynomial-time algorithms for other cases of MatIsoLie, which allow us to mostly derandomize a recent result of Kayal on affine equivalence of polynomials.

Abstract:We study the boundary of tractability for the Max-Cut problem in graphs. Our main result shows that Max-Cut above the Edwards-Erdos bound is fixed-parameter tractable: we give an algorithm that for any connected graph with <i>n</i> vertices and <i>m</i> edges finds a cut of size m/2+n-1/4+k in time 2 <i>O</i>(<i>k</i>)&middot;<i>n</i><sup>4</sup>, or decides that no such cut exists. This answers a long-standing open question from parameterized complexity that has been posed a number of times over the past 15 years. Our algorithm is asymptotically optimal, under the Exponential Time Hypothesis, and is strengthened by a polynomial-time computable kernel of polynomial size.

Abstract:Clustering under most popular objective functions is NP-hard, even to approximate well, and so unlikely to be efficiently solvable in the worst case. Recently, Bilu and Linial (2010) [11] suggested an approach aimed at bypassing this computational barrier by using properties of instances one might hope to hold in practice. In particular, they argue that instances in practice should be stable to small perturbations in the metric space and give an efficient algorithm for clustering instances of the Max-Cut problem that are stable to perturbations of size O(n<sup>1/2</sup>). In addition, they conjecture that instances stable to as little as O(1) perturbations should be solvable in polynomial time. In this paper we prove that this conjecture is true for any center-based clustering objective (such as k-median, k-means, and k-center). Specifically, we show we can efficiently find the optimal clustering assuming only stability to factor-3 perturbations of the underlying metric in spaces without Steiner points, and stability to factor 2+&radic;3 perturbations for general metrics. In particular, we show for such instances that the popular Single-Linkage algorithm combined with dynamic programming will find the optimal clustering. We also present NP-hardness results under a weaker but related condition. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:A classical result by Edwards states that every connected graph <i>G</i> on <i>n</i> vertices and <i>m</i> edges has a cut of size at least m/2 + (n-1)/4. We generalize this result to <i>r</i>-hypergraphs, with a suitable notion of connectivity that coincides with the notion of connectivity on graphs for <i>r</i> = 2. More precisely, we show that for every &ldquo;partition connected&rdquo; <i>r</i>-hypergraph (every hyperedge is of size at most <i>r</i>) <i>H</i> over a vertex set <i>V</i>(<i>H</i>), and edge set <i>E</i>(<i>H</i>) = {<i>e</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>e</i><sub>2</sub>,...<i>e</i><sub>m</sub>}, there always exists a 2-coloring of <i>V</i>(<i>H</i>) with {1, - 1} such that the number of hyperedges that have a vertex assigned 1 as well as a vertex assigned - 1 (or get &ldquo;split&rdquo;) is at least &mu;<sub>H</sub>+(n-1)/(r2<sup>r-1</sup>). Here &mu;<sub>H</sub> =&Sigma;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>m</sup>(1-22<sup>|ei|</sup>) = &Sigma;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>m</sup>(1-2<sup>1/|ei|</sup>). We use our result to show that a version of <i>r</i> -Set Splitting, namely, Above Average <i>r</i> -SET SPLITTING (AA- <i>r</i> -SS), is fixed parameter tractable (FPT). Observe that a random 2-coloring that sets each vertex of the hypergraph <i>H</i> to 1 or - 1 with equal probability always splits at least <i>&mu;</i><sub>H</sub> hyperedges. In AA- <i>r</i> -SS, we are given an <i>r</i>-hypergraph <i>H</i> and a positive integer <i>k</i> and the question is whether there exists a 2-coloring of <i>V</i>(<i>H</i>) that splits at least <i>&mu;</i><sub>H</sub> + <i>k</i> hyperedges. We give an algorithm for AA- <i>r</i> -SS that runs in time <i>f</i>(<i>k</i>)<i>n O</i>(1), showing that it is FPT, even when <i>r</i> = <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> log<i>n</i>, for every fixed constant <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> &lt; 1. Prior to our work AA- <i>r</i> -SS was known to be FPT only for constant <i>r</i>. We also complement our algorithmic result by showing that unless NP &sube; DTIME(<i>n</i><sup>loglogn</sup>), AA-[log<i>n</i>]-SS is not in <i>X</i>P.

Abstract:The unconstrained binary quadratic programming (UBQP) problem is a general NP-hard problem with various applications. In this paper, we present a multilevel algorithm designed to approximate large UBQP instances. The proposed multilevel algorithm is composed of a backbone-based coarsening phase, an asymmetric uncoarsening phase and a memetic refinement phase, where the backbone-based procedure and the memetic refinement procedure make use of tabu search to obtain improved solutions. Evaluated on a set of 11 largest instances from the literature (with 5000 to 7000 variables), the proposed algorithm proves to be able to attain all the best known values with a computing effort less than any existing approach.

Abstract:We construct a small set of explicit linear transformations mapping &Rdbl;<sup>n</sup> to &Rdbl;<sup>t</sup>, where t = O(log(&gamma;-1)&Epsilon; <sup>-2</sup>), such that the L<inf>2</inf> norm of any vector in &Rdbl;<sup>n</sup> is distorted by at most 1 &plusmn; &Epsilon; in at least a fraction of 1-&gamma; of the transformations in the set. Albeit the tradeoff between the size of the set and the success probability is suboptimal compared with probabilistic arguments, we nevertheless are able to apply our construction to a number of problems. In particular, we use it to construct an &Epsilon;-sample (or pseudorandom generator) for linear threshold functions on S<sup>n-1</sup> for &Epsilon; = o(1). We also use it to construct an &Epsilon;-sample for spherical digons in S<sup>n-1</sup> for &Epsilon; = o(1). This construction leads to an efficient oblivious derandomization of the Goemans-Williamson Max-Cut algorithm and similar approximation algorithms (i.e., we construct a small set of hyperplanes such that for any instance we can choose one of them to generate a good solution). Our technique for constructing an &Epsilon;-sample for linear threshold functions on the sphere is considerably different than previous techniques that rely on k-wise independent sample spaces. &copy; 2012 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

Abstract:This paper proposes a column generation approach based on the Lagrangean relaxation with clusters to solve the unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem that consists of maximizing a quadratic objective function by the choice of suitable values for binary decision variables. The proposed method treats a mixed binary linear model for the quadratic problem with constraints represented by a graph. This graph is partitioned in clusters of vertices forming sub-problems whose solutions use the dual variables obtained by a coordinator problem. The column generation process presents alternative ways to find upper and lower bounds for the quadratic problem. Computational experiments were performed using hard instances and the proposed method was compared against other methods presenting improved results for most of these instances.

Abstract:This paper presents a new alternative of Lagrangian decomposition based on column generation technique to solve the unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem. We use a mixed binary linear version of the original quadratic problem with constraints represented by a graph. This graph is partitioned into clusters of vertices forming subproblems whose solutions use the dual variables obtained by a coordinator problem. Computational experiments consider a set of difficult instances and the results are compared against other methods reported recently in the literature. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:A classical result by Edwards states that every connected graph G on n vertices and m edges has a cut of size at least m/2 + n-1/4. We generalize this result to r-hypergraphs, with a suitable notion of connectivity that coincides with the notion of connectivity on graphs for r = 2. More precisely, we show that for every "partition connected" r-hypergraph (every hyperedge is of size at most r) H over a vertex set V(H), and edge set E(H) = {e <inf>1</inf>,e<inf>2</inf>, &mellip; e<inf>m</inf>}, there always exists a 2-coloring of V(H) with {1,-1} such that the number of hyperedges that have a vertex assigned 1 as well as a vertex assigned -1 (or get "split") is at least &mu;<inf>H</inf> + n-1/r2<sup>r-1</sup>. Here &mu;<inf>H</inf> = <sup>m</sup><inf>i=1</inf> (1-2/2<sup>|ei|</sup>) =<sup>m</sup><inf>i=1</inf> (1-2<sup>1-|ei|</sup>). We use our result to show that a version of r -Set Splitting, namely, Above Average r -Set Splitting (AA-r-SS), is fixed parameter tractable (FPT). Observe that a random 2-coloring that sets each vertex of the hypergraph H to 1 or -1 with equal probability always splits at least &mu;<inf>H</inf> hyperedges. In AA- r -SS, we are given an r-hypergraph H and a positive integer &kappa; and the question is whether there exists a 2-coloring of V(H) that splits at least &mu;<inf>H</inf> +k hyperedges. We give an algorithm for AA-r-SS that runs in time f(&kappa;)n<sup>O(1)</sup>, showing that it is FPT, even when r = c<inf>1</inf> logn, for every fixed constant c <inf>1</inf> &lt; 1. Prior to our work AA-r-SS was known to be FPT only for constant r. We also complement our algorithmic result by showing that unless NP &sube; DTIME(n<sup>log log n</sup> ), AA-&lceil;logn&rceil;-SS is not in XP. &copy; 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract:A k-cut of a graph G = (V, E) is a partition of its vertex set into k parts; the size of the k-cut is the number of edges with endpoints in distinct parts. MAX-k-CUT is the optimization problem of finding a k-cut of maximal size and the case where k = 2 (often called MAX-CUT) has attracted a lot of attention from the research community. MAX-CUT - more generally, MAX-k-CUT - is NP-hard and it appears in many applications under various disguises. In this paper, we consider the MAX-CUT problem on random connected graphs script C(n, m) and on Erdocombining double acute accents-Re&acute;nyi random graphs script G(n, m). More specifically, we consider the distance from bipartiteness of a graph G = (V, E), the minimum number of edge deletions needed to turn it into a bipartite graph. If we denote this distance DISTBIP (G), the size of the MAX-CUT of a graph G = (V, E) is clearly given by |E| - DISTBIP (G). Fix &Epsilon; &gt; 0. For random connected graphs, we prove that asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s) DISTBIP (script C(n,m)) &sim; m-n/4 whenever m = n + O(n<sup>1-&Epsilon;</sup>). For sparse random graphs script G(n,m = n/2 + &mu;n<sup>2/3</sup>/2) we show that DISTBIP (script G(n,m)) is a.a.s about (2m-n)<sup>3</sup>/6n<sup>2</sup>+ 1/12 log n-1/4 log &mu; for any 1 &Lt; &mu; &le O(n<sup>1/3-&Epsilon;</sup>).

Abstract:This work is concerned with approximating constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) with additional global cardinality constraints. For example, MAX CUT is a boolean CSP where the input is a graph G = (V, E) and the goal is to find a cut S &cup; S&macr; = V that maximizes the number of crossing edges, |E(S, S&macr;)|. The MAX BISECTION problem is a variant of MAX CUT with a global constraint that each side of the cut has exactly half the vertices, i.e., |5| = |V|/2. Several other natural optimization problems like MIN BISECTION and approximating Graph Expansion can be formulated as CSPs with global cardinality constraints. In this work, we formulate a general approach towards approximating CSPs with global cardinality constraints using SDP hierarchies. To demonstrate the approach we present the following results: - Using the Lasserre hierarchy, we present an algorithm that runs in time O(n<sup>poly(1/&Epsilon;)</sup>) that given an instance of MAX BISECTION with value 1 - &Epsilon;, finds a bisection with value 1 - O(&radic;&Epsilon;). This approximation is near-optimal (up to constant factors in O()) under the Unique Games Conjecture. - By a computer-assisted proof, we show that the same algorithm also achieves a 0.85-approximation for MAX BISECTION, improving on the previous bound of 0.70 (note that it is UNIQUE GAMES hard to approximate better than a 0.878 factor). The same algorithm also yields a 0.92-approximation for MAX 2-SAT with cardinality constraints. - For every CSP with a global cardinality constraints, we present a generic conversion from integrality gap instances for the Lasserre hierarchy to a dictatorship test whose soundness is at most integrality gap. Dictatorship testing gadgets are central to hardness results for CSPs, and a generic conversion of the above nature lies at the core of the tight Unique Games based hardness result for CSPs [Rag08].

Abstract:We describe an improved technique for handling large numbers of cutting planes when using an interior-point method for the solution of linear and semi-definite programming relaxations of combinatorial optimization problems. The approach combines an infeasible primal-dual interior-point algorithm with a cutting-plane scheme that does not solve successive relaxations to optimality, but adds and removes cuts at intermediate iterates based on indicators for cut violation and feasibility of the associated slacks. The slack variables of added cuts are initialized using a recently proposed interior-point warm-start technique that relaxes the interiority condition on the original primal-dual variables and enables a restart from the current iterate without additional centring or correction steps. Our computational tests on relaxations of the maximum-cut and single-row facility-layout problem demonstrate that this new scheme is robust for both unconstrained and constrained binary quadratic problems and that its performance is superior to solving only the final relaxation with all relevant cuts known in advance. &copy; 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Abstract:This paper presents two algorithms combining GRASP and Tabu Search for solving the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming (UBQP) problem. We first propose a simple GRASP-Tabu Search algorithm working with a single solution and then reinforce it by introducing a population management strategy. Both algorithms are based on a dedicated randomized greedy construction heuristic and a tabu search procedure. We show extensive computational results on two sets of 31 large random UBQP instances and one set of 54 structured instances derived from the MaxCut problem. Comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. It is noteworthy that the reinforced GRASP-Tabu Search algorithm is able to improve the previous best known results for 19 MaxCut instances. &copy; 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract:We propose a heuristic for 0/1 programs based on the recent "joint+marginal" approach of the first author for parametric polynomial optimization. The idea is to first consider the n-variable (x1, . . . , xn) problem as a (n-1)-variable problem (x2, . . . , xn) with the variable x1 being now a parameter taking value in {0, 1}. One then solves a hierarchy of what we call "joint+marginal" semidefinite relaxations whose duals provide a sequence of polynomial approximations x1 &rarr; Jk (x1) that converges to the optimal value function J (x1) (as a function of the parameter x1). One considers a fixed index k in the hierarchy and if Jk (1) &gt; Jk (0) then one decides x1 = 1 and x1 = 0 otherwise. The quality of the approximation depends on how large k can be chosen (in general, for significant size problems, k = 1 is the only choice). One iterates the procedure with now a (n-2)-variable problem with one parameter x2 &Epsilon; {0, 1}, etc. Variants are also briefly described as well as some preliminary numerical experiments on the MAXCUT, k-cluster and 0/1 knapsack problems. &copy; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2011.

Abstract:This paper investigates a new heterogeneous method that dynamically sets the migration period of a distributed Genetic Algorithm (dGA). Each island GA of this multipopulation technique self-adapts the period for exchanging information with the other islands regarding the local evolution process. Thus, the different islands can develop different migration settings behaving like a heterogeneous dGA. The proposed algorithm is tested on a large set of instances of the Max-Cut problem, and it can be easily applied to other optimization problems. The results of this heterogeneous dGA are competitive with the best existing algorithms, with the added advantage of avoiding time-consuming preliminary tests for tuning the algorithm. &copy; 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Abstract:A binary tanglegram is a drawing of a pair of rooted binary trees whose leaf sets are in one-to-one correspondence; matching leaves are connected by inter-tree edges. For applications, for example, in phylogenetics, it is essential that both trees are drawn without edge crossings and that the inter-tree edges have as few crossings as possible. It is known that finding a tanglegram with the minimum number of crossings is NP-hard and that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to that number. We prove that under the Unique Games Conjecture there is no constant-factor approximation for binary trees. We show that the problem is NP-hard even if both trees are complete binary trees. For this case we give an O(n <sup>3</sup>)-time 2-approximation and a new, simple fixed-parameter algorithm. We show that the maximization version of the dual problem for binary trees can be reduced to a version of MaxCut for which the algorithm of Goemans and Williamson yields a 0.878-approximation. &copy; 2010 The Author(s).

Abstract:The MAX-CUT problem asks for partitioning the nodes V of a graph G = (V, E) into two sets (one of which might be empty), such that the sum of weights of edges joining nodes in different partitions is maximum. Whereas for general instances the MAX-CUT problem is NP-hard, it is polynomially solvable for certain classes of graphs. For planar graphs, there exist several polynomial-time methods determining maximum cuts for arbitrary choice of edge weights. Typically, the problem is solved by computing a minimum-weight perfect matching in some associated graph. The most efficient known algorithms are those of Shih et al. (IEEE Trans. Comput. 39(5):694-697, 1990) and that of Berman et al. (WADS, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 1663, pp. 25-36, Springer, Berlin, 1999). The running time of the former can be bounded by O(|V| 3/2 log |V|). The latter algorithm is more generally for determining T-joins in graphs. Although it has a slightly larger bound on the running time of O(|V| 3/2 (log|V|) 3/2)&alpha;(|V|), where &alpha;(|V|) is the inverse Ackermann function, it can solve large instances in practice. In this work, we present a new and simple algorithm for determining maximum cuts for arbitrary weighted planar graphs. Its running time is bounded by O(|V| 3/2 log|V|), the same bound achieved by Shih et al. It can easily determine maximum cuts in huge random as well as real-world graphs with up to 10<sup>6</sup> nodes. We present experimental results for our method using two different matching implementations. We furthermore compare our approach with those of Shih et al. and Berman et al. It turns out that our algorithm is considerably faster in practice than Shih et al. Moreover, it yields a much smaller associated graph. Its expanded graph size is comparable to that of Berman et al. However, whereas the procedure of generating the expanded graph in Berman et al. is very involved (thus needs a sophisticated implementation), implementing our approach is an easy and straightforward task. &copy; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

Abstract:We consider the positive semidefinite (psd) matrices with binary entries, along with the corresponding integer polytopes. We begin by establishing some basic properties of these matrices and polytopes. Then, we show that several families of integer polytopes in the literature-the cut, boolean quadric, multicut and clique partitioning polytopes-are faces of binary psd polytopes. Finally, we present some implications of these polyhedral relationships. In particular, we answer an open question in the literature on the max-cut problem, by showing that the rounded psd inequalities define a polytope. &copy; 2010 Springer and Mathematical Programming Society.

Abstract:Lovasz and Schrijver described a generic method of tightening the LP and SDP relaxation for any 0-1 optimization problem. These tightened relaxations were the basis of several celebrated approximation algorithms (such as for MAX-CUT, MAX-3SAT, and SPARSEST CUT). We prove strong inapproximability results in this model for well-known problems such as MAX-3SAT, HYPERGRAPH VERTEX COVER and SET COVER. We show that the relaxations produced by as many as &Omega;(n) rounds of the LS<sub>+</sub> procedure do not allow nontrivial approximation, thus ruling out the possibility that the LS<sub>+</sub> approach gives even slightly subexponential approximation algorithms for these problems. We also point out why our results are somewhat incomparable to known inapproximability results proved using PCPs, and formalize several interesting open questions. We survey results that built upon this work.

Abstract:The class of problems known as quadratic zero-one (binary) unconstrained optimisation has provided access to a vast array of combinatorial optimisation problems, allowing them to be expressed within the setting of a single unifying model. A gap exists, however, in addressing polynomial problems of degree greater than 2. To bridge this gap, we provide methods for efficiently executing core search processes for the general polynomial unconstrained binary (PUB) optimisation problem. A variety of search algorithms for quadratic optimisation can take advantage of our methods to be transformed directly into algorithms for problems where the objective functions involve arbitrary polynomials. Part 1 of this paper (Glover et al., 2011) provided fundamental results for carrying out the transformations and described coding and decoding procedures relevant for efficiently handling sparse problems, where many coefficients are 0, as typically arise in practical applications. In the present part 2 paper, we provide special algorithms and data structures for taking advantage of the basic results of part 1. We also disclose how our designs can be used to enhance existing quadratic optimisation algorithms.

Abstract:Aiming to improve NC machine energy utilization rate, a conception of EDF which reflected the control mechanism and elements of product's energy property in design was introduced. The extraction of NC machine EDFs was based on the analysis of NC machine energy consumption model in use stage, especially the elements which had energy features, such as the mechanism driving system, the electric control system and the assistant system. Identify the strong controllable energy factor aggregation F was identified and the EDFs aggregation C through qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis was obtained. In addition, the decomposition process of coupling EDFs which contain load loss modulus b and max cut width b<sub>Dlim</sub> was given.

Abstract:The unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem (QP) is a classical non-linear problem of optimizing a quadratic objective by a suitable choice of binary decision variables. This paper proposes new Lagrangean decompositions to find bounds for QP. The methods presented treat a mixed binary linear version (LQP) of QP with constraints represented by a graph. This graph is partitioned into clusters of vertices forming a dual problem that is solved by a subgradient algorithm. The subproblems formed by the generated subgraphs are solved by CPLEX. Computational experiments consider a data set formed by several difficult instances with different features. The results show the efficiency of the proposed methods over traditional Lagrangean relaxations and other methods found in the literature. &copy; 2009 The Authors.

Abstract:In this paper, the potential of the path relinking method for the maximum cut problem is investigated. This method is embedded within global equilibrium search to utilize the set of high quality solutions provided by the latter. The computational experiment on a set of standard benchmark problems is provided to study the proposed approach. The empirical experiments reveal that the large sizes of the elite set lead to restart distribution of the running times, i.e., the algorithm can be accelerated by simply removing all of the accumulated data (set P) and re-initiating its execution after a certain number of elite solutions is obtained.

Abstract:We consider a hierarchical relaxation, called Handelman hierarchy, for a class of polynomial optimization problems. We prove that the rank of Handelman hierarchy, if applied to a standard quadratic formulation of Max-Cut, is exactly the same as the number of nodes of the underlying graph. Also we give an error bound for Handelman hierarchy, in terms of its level, applied to the Max-Cut formulation. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:Computing approximate solutions for NP-hard problems is an important research endeavor. Since the work of Goemans-Williamson in 1993, semidefinite programming (a form of convex programming in which the variables are vector inner products) has been used to design the current best approximation algorithms for problems such as MAX-CUT, MAX-3SAT, SPARSEST CUT, GRAPH COLORING, etc. The talk will survey this area, as well as its fascinating connections with topics such as geometric embeddings of metric spaces, and Khot's unique games conjecture. The talk will be self-contained.

Abstract:Spectrum sharing in OFDM-based Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN) is investigated by using graph theory. We consider the networks in which a set of secondary links (SLs) make underlay access to support single-hop ad hoc transmission. Spectrum sharing must be carried out in SLs so that no excessive interference is caused to links of the primary network and maximizes the total achievable rates of SLs. We divide the spectrum sharing into two stages: coarse-scale interference mitigation and SINR-based channel mapping. Interference mitigation is done through constructing weighted undirected interference graph and applying k-max cut method. Then we perform channel-cluster mapping, which takes instantaneous channel quality into consider, on the basis of interference mitigation. Low-complexity heuristic algorithms are proposed to effectively solve the problems of each stage. Numerical simulations for various scenarios are executed to show the superior performance of the proposed schemes.

Abstract:Unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem (UBQP) consists in maximizing a quadratic 0-1 function. It is a well known NP-hard problem and is considered as a unified model for a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. This paper combines a tabu Hopfield neural network (HNN) (THNN) with estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), and thus a THNN-EDA is proposed for the UBQP. In the THNN, the tabu rule, instead of the original updating rule of the HNN, is used to govern the state transition or updating of neurons to search for the global minimum of the energy function. A probability vector in EDA model is built to characterize the distribution of promising solutions in the search space, and then the THNN is guided by the global search information in EDA model to search better solution in the promising region. Thus, the short term memory of the tabu mechanism in the THNN cooperates with the long term memory mechanism in the EDA to help the network escape from local minima. The THNN-EDA is tested on 21 UBQP benchmark problems with the size ranging from 3000 to 7000, and 48 maximum cut benchmark problems, a special case of the UBQP, with the size ranging from 512 to 3375. Simulation results show that the THNN-EDA is better than the other HNN based algorithms, and is better than or competitive with metaheuristic algorithms and state-of-the-art algorithms.

Abstract:In Choi (Quantum Inf Process, 7:193-209, 2008), we introduced the notion of minor-embedding in adiabatic quantum optimization. A minor-embedding of a graph <i>G</i> in a quantum hardware graph <i>U</i> is a subgraph of <i>U</i> such that <i>G</i> can be obtained from it by contracting edges. In this paper, we describe the intertwined adiabatic quantum architecture design problem, which is to construct a hardware graph <i>U</i> that satisfies all known physical constraints and, at the same time, permits an efficient minor-embedding algorithm. We illustrate an optimal complete-graph-minor hardware graph. Given a family F of graphs, a (host) graph <i>U</i> is called F-minor-universal if for each graph <i>G</i> in F, U contains a minor-embedding of <i>G</i>. The problem for designing a F-minor-universal hardware graph <i>U</i><sub>sparse</sub> in which F consists of a family of sparse graphs (e.g., bounded degree graphs) is open.

Abstract:Video scene segmentation is a fundamental step for video summarization and browsing, which is a very promising application of multimedia analysis. There are two key elements, namely, boundary evaluation and boundary searching, in a scene segmentation algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel boundary evaluation criterion, including the multiple normalized min-max cut scores, which consider not only neighboring but non-neighboring scene similarities with a memory-fading model, and the maximal cross-boundary strict shot similarity, which considers both color and structure similarities. Dynamic programming with a heuristic search scheme is adopted to quickly find the global optimal scene boundary sequence. Moreover, a Monte Carlo method is adopted to improve the stability of the searching process. Experimental results on a dataset of 40 diversified videos have proven the algorithm efficient, robust, and superior to the existent methods. &copy; 2011 IEEE.

Abstract:Optimum channel/frequency allocation problem in a general mobile radio networks is well-known to be NP-complete. The optimum general solution for a mobile radio network for even 2-channel case is not known. In this paper, we focus on the case L = 2<sup>k</sup> where L is the number of channels/frequencies and k is a positive integer. In order to minimize the sum of the network level interference, we show that a hybrid solution (first finding the maximum eigenvector centrally and then running the well-known distributed standard minimum-interference-channel-allocation algorithm) outperforms both the spectral solution and the standard distributive algorithm. The proposed solution can be adopted by any cellular, cognitive, ad-hoc or mesh type radio networks. &copy; 2011 Univ of Sarajevo.

Abstract:The updating rule of the original discrete Hopfield neural network (DHNN) is based on gradient descent dynamics, which always leads to the local minima problem. In this paper, by introducing the idea of the simulated annealing (SA) into the DHNN, we first propose an annealing HNN (AHNN) that permits temporary energy ascent to help the DHNN escape from local minima. Then, from a cooperative perspective, a population of the AHNN processes are simultaneously implemented and coupled by their acceptance probabilities, and thus a cooperative AHNN (CoAHNN) is proposed. The primary objective of the coupling in the CoAHNN is to create cooperative behavior via information exchange among neural networks. This objective helps in the decision of whether uphill moves will be accepted. In addition, coupling can provide information used online to guide the networks toward the global optimum. The CoAHNN is tested on 21 unconstrained binary quadratic programming problems (UBQP) with the size ranging from 3000 to 7000, and 48 maximum cut benchmark problems, a special case of the UBQP, with the size ranging from 512 to 3375. The UBQP consists in maximizing a quadratic 0-1 function. It is a well known NP-hard problem and is considered as a unified model for a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. Simulation results show that the CoAHNN is better than or competitive with other HNN based algorithms, metaheuristic algorithms and state-of-the-art algorithms. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:Submodular maximization generalizes many important problems including Max Cut in directed and undirected graphs and hypergraphs, certain constraint satisfaction problems, and maximum facility location problems. Unlike the problem of minimizing submodular functions, the problem of maximizing submodular functions is NP-hard. In this paper, we design the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for maximizing nonnegative (non-monotone) submodular functions. In particular, we give a deterministic local-search 1/3-approximation and a randomized 2/5-approximation algorithm for maximizing nonnegative submodular functions. We also show that a uniformly random set gives a 1/4-approximation. For symmetric submodular functions, we show that a random set gives a 1/2-approximation, which can also be achieved by deterministic local search. These algorithms work in the value oracle model, where the submodular function is accessible through a black box returning f(S) for a given set S. We show that in this model, a (1/2 + &epsi;)-approximation for symmetric submodular functions would require an exponential number of queries for any fixed &epsi; &gt; 0. In the model where f is given explicitly (as a sum of nonnegative submodular functions, each depending only on a constant number of elements), we prove NP-hardness of (5/6 + &epsi;)-approximation in the symmetric case and NP-hardness of (3/4 + &epsi;)-approximation in the general case.

Abstract:The parallel repetition theorem states that, for any two-prover game with value 1 - e (for, say, &epsi; &lt; 1/2), the value of the game repeated in parallel n times is at most (1 - &epsi;<sup>c</sup>)<sup>&Omega;(n/s)</sup>, where s is the answer's length (of the original game) and c is a universal constant [R. Raz, SIAM J. Comput., 27 (1998), pp. 763-803]. Several researchers asked "whether this bound could be improved to (1 - &epsi;)<sup>&Omega;(n/s)</sup>; this question is usually referred to as the strong parallel repetition problem. We show that the answer to this question is negative. More precisely, we consider the odd cycle game of size m, a two-prover game with value 1 - 1/2m. We show that the value of the odd cycle game repeated in parallel n times is at least 1 - (1/m) &middot; O(&radic;n). This implies that, for large enough n (say. n &ges; &Omega;(m<sup>2</sup>)), the value of the odd cycle game repeated in parallel n times is at least (1 - 1/4m<sup>2</sup>)<sup>O(n)</sup>. Thus the following hold. 1. For parallel repetition of general games, the bounds of (1 - &epsi;<sup>c</sup>)<sup>&Omega;(n/s)</sup> given in [R. Raz, SIAM J. Comput., 27 (1998), pp. 763-803; T. Holenstein, in Proceedings of STOC 2002, ACM, New York, 2002, pp. 767-775] are of the right form, up to determining the exact value of the constant c &ges; 2. 2. For parallel repetition of XOR games, unique games, and projection games, the bounds of (1 - &epsi;<sup>2</sup>)<sup>&Omega;(n/s)</sup> given in [U. Feige, G. Kindler, and R. O'Donnell, in Proceedings of CCC 2007, IEEE Computer Society, Washington, DC, 2007, pp. 179-192] (for XOR games) and in [A. Rao, in Proceedings of STOC 2008, ACM, New York, 2008, pp. 1-10] (for unique and projection games) are tight. 3. For parallel repetition of the odd cycle game, the bound of 1 - (1/m) &middot; &Omega;&tilde;(&radic;n) given in [U. Feige, G. Kindler, and R. O'Donnell, in Proceedings of CCC 2007, IEEE Computer Society, Washington, DC, 2007, pp. 179-192] is almost tight. A major motivation for the recent interest in the strong parallel repetition problem is that a strong parallel repetition theorem would have implied that the unique game conjecture is equivalent to the NP hardness of distinguishing between instances of Max-Cut that are at least 1 - &epsi;<sup>2</sup> satisfiable from instances that are at most 1 - (2/&pi;) &middot; &epsi; satisfiable. Our results suggest that this cannot be proved just by improving the known bounds on parallel repetition.

Abstract:We consider the problem of finding a local optimum for the Max-Cut problem with FLIP-neighborhood, in which exactly one node changes the partition. Scha&uml;ffer and Yannakakis (SICOMP, 1991) showed PLS-completeness of this problem on graphs with unbounded degree. On the other side, Poljak (SICOMP, 1995) showed that in cubic graphs every FLIP local search takes <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) steps, where <i>n</i> is the number of nodes. Due to the huge gap between degree three and unbounded degree, Ackermann, Ro&uml;glin, and Vo&uml;cking (JACM, 2008) asked for the smallest <i>d</i> such that on graphs with maximum degree <i>d</i> the local Max-Cut problem with FLIP-neighborhood is PLS-complete. In this paper, we prove that the computation of a local optimum on graphs with maximum degree five is PLS-complete. Thus, we solve the problem posed by Ackermann et al. almost completely by showing that <i>d</i> is either four or five (unless PLS &sube; P). On the other side, we also prove that on graphs with degree O(logn) every FLIP local search has probably polynomial smoothed complexity. Roughly speaking, for any instance, in which the edge weights are perturbated by a (Gaussian) random noise with variance <i>&sigma;</i><sup>2</sup>, every FLIP local search terminates in time polynomial in <i>n</i> and <i>&sigma;</i><sup>-1</sup>, with probability 1 - <i>n</i><sup>-&Omega;(1)</sup>. Putting both results together, we may conclude that although local Max-Cut is likely to be hard on graphs with bounded degree, it can be solved in polynomial time for slightly perturbated instances with high probability.

Abstract:A new method based on a mathematically natural local search framework for max cut is developed to uncover functionally coherent module and BPM motifs in high-throughput genetic interaction data. Unlike previous methods which also consider physical protein-protein interaction data, our method utilizes genetic interaction data only; this becomes increasingly important as high-throughput genetic interaction data is becoming available in settings where less is known about physical interaction data. We compare modules and BPMs obtained to previous methods and across different datasets. Despite needing no physical interaction information, the BPMs produced by our method are competitive with previous methods. Biological findings include a suggested global role for the prefoldin complex and a SWR subcomplex in pathway buffering in the budding yeast interactome.

Abstract:We investigate two variable fixing strategies and two variable scoring strategies within a tabu search algorithm, using the unconstrained binary quadratic programming (UBQP) problem as a case study. In particular, we provide insights as to why one particular variable fixing and scoring strategy leads to better computational results than another one. For this purpose, we perform two investigations, the first analyzing deviations from the best known solution and the second analyzing the correlations between the fitness distances of high-quality solutions. We find that one of our strategies obtains the best solutions in the literature for all of the test problems examined.

Abstract:Automatic image annotation has been an active research direction due to its great importance in content-based image retrieval(CBIR). However, the results of existing image annotation methods are still far from practical. Therefore, it is of vital importance to design a high-performance approach which could refine the initial annotations. This paper presents a novel algorithm to solve image annotation refinement problem(IAR) by graph partition and image search engine. Our algorithm focuses on pruning the noisy words in candidate annotation set to enhance image annotation performance. The main idea of the proposed algorithm lies in that candidate annotations are served as graph vertices, and the relevance between two candidate annotations is used to construct the edge weight. Then, the image annotation refinement problem can be converted to the weighted graph partition problem. The edge weight is the annotation similarity weighted by two parameters. Parameter 1 is the relationship between candidate annotation and image visual features, and parameter 2 refers to the importance of candidate annotation in host Web page. Next, we compute max cut of the graph using a heuristic algorithm. After the graph is bi-partitioned, one of the two vertex sets is chosen as final annotations. Experimental results on non-Web images and Web images show that our algorithm outperforms the existing image annotation refinement techniques.

Abstract:In this paper, we present a relaxed version of the SpecHybrid Algorithm originally proposed for wireless cellular systems, and apply it to text document clustering problem. We conduct several experiments on two different datasets; a widely used benchmark dataset in English, and a Turkish textual dataset commonly used in text classification. Our results show that the proposed algorithm gives superior performance in text document clustering as compared to the standard k-means algorithm for any number of clusters while giving a comparable or better performance as compared to the standard EM algorithm for relatively large number of clusters depending on the similarity matrices used. &copy; 2011 IEEE.

Abstract:The bipartite edge frustration of a graph G, denoted by &phi;(G), is the smallest number of edges that have to be deleted from G to obtain a bipartite spanning subgraph of G. This topological index is related to the well-known Max-cut problem, and has important applications in computing stability of fullerenes. In this paper, the bipartite edge frustration of an infinite family of fullerenes is computed. Moreover, this quantity for four classes of graphs arising from a given graph under different types of edge subdivisions is investigated. &copy; 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract:In this paper, a new operator is proposed to optimize the traditional Hopfield neural network (HNN). The key idea is to incorporate the global search capability of the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) into the HNN, which typically has a powerful local search capability and fast operation. On account of this property of the EDA, our proposed algorithm also exhibits a powerful global search capability. In addition, the possible infeasible solutions generated during the re-sampling period of the EDA are eliminated by the HNN. Therefore, the merits of both these methods are combined in a unified framework. The proposed model is tested on a numerical example, the max-cut problem. The new and optimized model yielded a better performance than certain traditional intelligent optimization methods, such as HNN, genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed mutation Hopfield neural network (MHNN) is also used to solve a practical problem, aircraft landing scheduling (ALS). Compared with first-come-first-served sequence, MHNN sequence reduces both total landing time and total delay. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:We discuss the optimal allocation problem in combinatorial auction, where the items are allocated to bidders so that the sum of the bidders' utilities is maximized. In this paper, we consider the case where utility functions are given by quadratic functions; the class of quadratic utility functions has a succinct representation but is sufficiently general. The main aim of this paper is to show the computational complexity of the optimal allocation problem with quadratic utility functions. We consider the cases where utility functions are submodular and supermodular, and show NP-hardness and/or polynomial-time exact/approximation algorithm. These results are given by using the relationship with graph cut problems such as the min/max cut problem and the multiway cut problem. &copy; 2011 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract:We initiate a study of when the value of mathematical relaxations such as linear and semi-definite programs for constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) is approximately preserved when restricting the instance to a sub-instance induced by a small random subsample of the variables. Let C be a family of CSPs such as 3SAT, Max-Cut, etc., and let 11 be a mathematical program that is a relaxation for C, in the sense that for every instance P &euro C, II(P) is a number in [0,1] upper bounding the maximum fraction of satisfiable constraints of P. Loosely speaking, we say that subsampling holds for P and 11 if for every sufficiently dense instance P &euro C and every &Epsilon; &gt; 0, if we let P be the instance obtained by restricting'P to a sufficiently large constant number of variables, then II(P') &Epsilon; (1 &plusmn; &Epsilon;)II(P). We say that weak subsampling holds if the above guarantee is replaced with II(P') = 1 - &Theta;(&gamma;) whenever II(P) = 1 - &gamma;, where &Theta; hides only absolute constants. We obtain both positive and negative results, showing that: 1. Subsampling holds for the BasicLP and BasicSDP programs. BasicSDP is a variant of the semi-definite program considered by R.aghavendra (2008), who showed it gives an optimal approximation factor for every constraint-satisfaction problem under the unique games conjecture. BasicLP is the linear programming analog of BasicSDP. For tighter versions of BasicSDP obtained by adding additional constraints from the Lasserre hierarchy, weak subsampling holds for CSPs of unique games type. There are noa-unique CSPs for which even weak subsampling fails for the above tighter semi-definite programs. Also there are unique CSPs for which (even weak) subsampling fails for the Sherali-Adams linear programming hierarchy. As a corollary of our weak subsampling for strong semi-definite programs, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm to certify that random geometric graphs (of the type considered by Feige and Schechtman, 2002) of max-cut value 1 - &gamma; have a cut value at most 1 - &gamma;/10. More generally, our results give an approach to obtaining average-case algorithms for CSPs using seaii-definite programming hierarchies.

Abstract:We consider the performance of two classic approximation algorithms which work by scanning the input and greedily constructing a solution. We investigate whether running these algorithms on a random permutation of the input can increase their performance ratio. We obtain the following results: Johnson's approximation algorithm for MAX-SAT is one of the first approximation algorithms to be rigorously analyzed. It has been shown that the performance ratio of this algorithm is 2/3. We show that when executed on a random permutation of the variables, the performance ratio of this algorithm is improved to 2/3 + c for some c &gt; 0 This resolves an open problem of Chen, Friesen and Zhang [JCSS 1999]. (See also the paper by Poloczek and Schnitger in these proceedings for related results on this algorithm and its variants). Motivated by the above improvement, we consider the performance of the greedy algorithm for MAX-CUT whose performance ratio is 1/2. Our hope was that running the greedy algorithm on a random permutation of the vertices would result in a 1/2 + c approximation algorithm. However, it turns out that in this case the performance of the algorithm remains 1/2. This resolves an open problem of Mathieu and Schudy [SODA 2008].

Abstract:A new bioinformatics pipeline for fosmid based analysis was developed by extending the standard SOLiD pipeline for NGS. The experimental approach starts by sequencing pools of up to 15000 DNA molecules called fosmids. Each fosmid has an average length of 40kb and is sampled at random from the genome. The pipeline includes an algorithm for fosmids detection which clusters SOLiD reads aligned to the reference genome based on a custom made set of proximity rules. It also includes a module to make homozygous allele calling on regions identified as potential fosmid locations. These allele calls are collected in a matrix for single individual haplotyping. The pipeline includes a new algorithm for this bioinformatics problem which tries to find the cut of fosmids consistent with their haplotype origin. The algorithm reduces the problem to the well known NP-Complete problem called Max-CUT which was approximately solved by combining well known heuristics. Finally, the algorithm calculates the consensus haplotypes assuming that the cut is correct. After running the pipeline on 48 different pools, 32347 SNPs in 102 blocks on chromosome 22 of an individual with a predicted switch error rate of about 1% were phased.

Abstract:This paper presents a memetic clonal selection algorithm (MCSA) with estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) vaccination, named MCSA-EDA, for the unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem (UBQP). In order to improve the performance of the conventional clonal selection algorithm (CSA), three components are adopted in MCSA-EDA. First, to compensate for the absence of recombination among different antibodies, an EDA vaccination is designed and incorporated into CSA. Second, to keep the diversity of the population, a fitness uniform selection scheme (FUSS) is adopted as a selection operator. Third, to enhance the exploitation ability of CSA, an adaptive tabu search (TS) with feedback mechanism is introduced. Thus, MCSA-EDA can overcome the deficiencies of CSA and further search better solutions. MCSA-EDA is tested on a series of UBQP with size up to 7000 variables. Simulation results show that MCSA-EDA is effective for improving the performance of the conventional CSA and is better than or at least competitive with other existing metaheuristic algorithms.

Abstract:In this paper, a structured max-margin learning algorithm is developed to achieve more effective training of a large number of inter-related classifiers for multilabel image annotation application. To leverage multilabel images for classifier training, each multilabel image is partitioned into a set of image instances (image regions or image patches) and an automatic instance label identification algorithm is developed to assign multiple labels (which are given at the image level) to the most relevant image instances. A K-way min-max cut algorithm is developed for automatic instance clustering and kernel weight determination, where multiple base kernels are seamlessly combined to address the issue of huge intra-concept visual diversity more effectively. Second, a visual concept network is constructed for characterizing the inter-concept visual similarity contexts more precisely in the high-dimensional multimodal feature space. The visual concept network is used to determine the inter-related learning tasks directly in the feature space rather than in the label space because feature space is the common space for classifier training and image classification. Third, a parallel computing platform is developed to achieve more effective learning of a large number of inter-related classifiers over the visual concept network. A structured max-margin learning algorithm is developed by incorporating the visual concept network, max-margin Markov networks and multitask learning to address the issue of huge inter-concept visual similarity more effectively. By leveraging the inter-concept visual similarity contexts for inter-related classifier training, our structured max-margin learning algorithm can significantly enhance the discrimination power of the inter-related classifiers. Our experiments have also obtained very positive results for a large number of object classes and image concepts. &copy; 2011 IEEE.

Abstract:We give a (computer assisted) proof that the edges of every graph with maximum degree 3 and girth at least 17 may be 5-colored (possibly improperly) so that the complement of each color class is bipartite. Equivalently, every such graph admits a homomorphism to the Clebsch graph (Fig. 1). Hopkins and Staton [J Graph Theory 6(2) (1982), 115-121] and Bondy and Locke [J Graph Theory 10(4) (1986), 477-504] proved that every (sub)cubic graph of girth at least 4 has an edge-cut containing at least of the edges. The existence of such an edge-cut follows immediately from the existence of a 5-edge-coloring as described above; so our theorem may be viewed as a coloring extension of their result (under a stronger girth assumption). Every graph which has a homomorphism to a cycle of length five has an above-described 5-edge-coloring; hence our theorem may also be viewed as a weak version of Nes&circ;etr&circ;il's Pentagon Problem (which asks whether every cubic graph of sufficiently high girth is homomorphic to C<inf>5</inf>).

Abstract:In this paper we consider low-rank semidefinite programming (LRSDP) relaxations of combinatorial quadratic problems that are equivalent to the maxcut problem. Using the Gramian representation of a positive semidefinite matrix, the LRSDP problem can be formulated as the nonconvex nonlinear programming problem of minimizing a quadratic function with quadratic equality constraints. For the solution of this problem we propose a continuously differentiable exact merit function that exploits the special structure of the constraints and we use this function to define an efficient and globally convergent algorithm. Finally, we test our code on an extended set of instances of the maxcut problem and we report comparisons with other existing codes. &copy; 2009 Springer and Mathematical Programming Society.

Abstract:We consider the problem of optimizing stream mining applications that are constructed as tree topologies of classifiers and deployed on a set of resource constrained and distributed processing nodes (or sensors). The optimization involves selecting appropriate false-alarm detection tradeoffs (operating points) for each classifier to minimize an end-to-end misclassification penalty, while satisfying resource constraints. We design distributed solutions, by defining tree configuration games, where individual classifiers configure themselves to maximize an appropriate local utility. We define the local utility functions and determine the information that needs to be exchanged across classifiers in order to design the distributed solutions. We analytically show that there is a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium in operating points, which guarantees convergence of the proposed approach. We develop both myopic strategy, where the utility is purely local to the current classifier, and foresighted strategy, where the utility includes impact of classifier's actions on successive classifiers. We analytically show that actions determined based on foresighted strategies improve the end-to-end performance of the classifier tree, by deriving an associated probability bound. We also investigate the impact of resource constraints on the classifier action selections for each strategy, and the corresponding application performance. We propose a learning-based approach, which enables each classifier to effectively adapt to the dynamic changes of resource constraints. We evaluate the performance of our solutions on an application for sports scene classification. We show that foresighted strategies result in better performance than myopic strategies in both resource unconstrained and resource constrained scenarios, and asymptotically approach the centralized optimal solution. We also show that the proposed distributed solutions outperform the centralized solution based on the Sequential Quadratic Programming on average in resource unconstrained scenarios. &copy; 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:We place our focus on the gap between treewidth's success in producing fixed-parameter polynomial algorithms for hard graph problems, and specifically Hamiltonian Circuit and Max Cut, and the failure of its directed variants (directed treewidth (Johnson et al., 2001 [13]), DAG-width (Obdrzlek, 2006 [14]) and Kelly-width (Hunter and Kreutzer, 2007 [15]) to replicate it in the realm of digraphs. We answer the question of why this gap exists by giving two hardness results: we show that Directed Hamiltonian Circuit is W[2]-hard when the parameter is the width of the input graph, for any of these widths, and that Max Di Cut remains NP-hard even when restricted to DAGs, which have the minimum possible width under all these definitions. Along the way, we extend our reduction for Directed Hamiltonian Circuit to show that the related Minimum Leaf Outbranching problem is also W[2]-hard when naturally parameterized by the number of leaves of the solution, even if the input graph has constant width. All our results also apply to directed pathwidth and cycle rank. &copy; 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract:We present a two phase interior point decomposition framework for solving semidefinite (SDP) relaxations of sparse maxcut, stable set, and box constrained quadratic programs. In phase 1, we suitably modify the matrix completion scheme of Fukuda et al. (SIAM J. Optim. 11:647-674, 2000) to preprocess an existing SDP into an equivalent SDP in the block-angular form. In phase 2, we solve the resulting block-angular SDP using a regularized interior point decomposition algorithm, in an iterative fashion between a master problem (a quadratic program); and decomposed and distributed subproblems (smaller SDPs) in a parallel and distributed high performance computing environment. We compare our MPI (Message Passing Interface) implementation of the decomposition algorithm on the distributed Henry2 cluster with the OpenMP version of CSDP (Borchers and Young in Comput. Optim. Appl. 37:355-369, 2007) on the IBM Power5 shared memory system at NC State University. Our computational results indicate that the decomposition algorithm (a) solves large SDPs to 2-3 digits of accuracy where CSDP runs out of memory; (b) returns competitive solution times with the OpenMP version of CSDP, and (c) attains a good parallel scalability. Comparing our results with Fujisawa et al. (Optim. Methods Softw. 21:17-39, 2006), we also show that a suitable modification of the matrix completion scheme can be used in the solution of larger SDPs than was previously possible.

Abstract:Background: Supertree methods represent one of the major ways by which the Tree of Life can be estimated, but despite many recent algorithmic innovations, matrix representation with parsimony (MRP) remains the main algorithmic supertree method. Results: We evaluated the performance of several supertree methods based upon the Quartets MaxCut (QMC) method of Snir and Rao and showed that two of these methods usually outperform MRP and five other supertree methods that we studied, under many realistic model conditions. However, the QMC-based methods have scalability issues that may limit their utility on large datasets. We also observed that taxon sampling impacted supertree accuracy, with poor results obtained when all of the source trees were only sparsely sampled. Finally, we showed that the popular optimality criterion of minimizing the total topological distance of the supertree to the source trees is only weakly correlated with supertree topological accuracy. Therefore evaluating supertree methods on biological datasets is problematic. Conclusions: Our results show that supertree methods that improve upon MRP are possible, and that an effort should be made to produce scalable and robust implementations of the most accurate supertree methods. Also, because topological accuracy depends upon taxon sampling strategies, attempts to construct very large phylogenetic trees using supertree methods should consider the selection of source tree datasets, as well as supertree methods. Finally, since supertree topological error is only weakly correlated with the supertree's topological distance to its source trees, development and testing of supertree methods presents methodological challenges.

Abstract:This paper presents a hybrid metaheuristic approach (HMA) for solving the unconstrained binary quadratic programming (UBQP) problem. By incorporating a tabu search procedure into the framework of evolutionary algorithms, the proposed approach exhibits several distinguishing features, including a diversification-based combination operator and a distance-and-quality based replacement criterion for pool updating. The proposed algorithm is able to easily obtain the best known solutions for 31 large random instances up to 7000 variables (which no previous algorithm has done) and find new best solutions for three of nine instances derived from the set-partitioning problem, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed algorithm in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. Furthermore, some key elements and properties of the HMA algorithm are also analyzed. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:We compute a complete linear description of the bipartite subgraph polytope, for up to seven nodes, and a conjectured complete description for eight nodes. We then show how these descriptions were used to compute the integrality ratio of various relaxations of the max-cut problem, again for up to eight nodes. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:We provide a method for efficiently evaluating two-flip moves that simultaneously change the values of two 0-1 variables in search methods for binary unconstrained quadratic optimisation problems (UQP). We extend a framework recently proposed by the authors for creating efficient evaluations of one-flip moves to yield a method requiring significantly less computation time than a direct sequential application of one-flips. A tabu search algorithm that combines one-flip and two-flip moves, in a study currently in process, has made use of this extension to produce very competitive results on some UQP benchmark instances.

Abstract:Using unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem as a case study, we investigate the role of multi-parent crossover operators within the memetic algorithm framework. We evaluate the performance of four multi-parent crossover operators (called MSX, Diagonal, U-Scan and OB-Scan) and provide evidences and insights as to why one particular multi-parent crossover operator leads to better computational results than another one. For this purpose, we employ several indicators like population entropy and average solution distance in the population.

Abstract:Support vector machine (SVM) can be seen as a special binary classification method. The original model is a quadratical programming with linear inequalities constraints. It is a very important issue that how to get the optimal solution of SVM model. In this paper, a new solution method is proposed. The constraints are moved away from the original optimization model by using the approximation solution in the feasible space. One control parameter smoothing function is used to smoothen the objective function of unconstrained model. The smoothing performance is investigated. By theory proof, the proposed unconstrained model has an active performance which can be controlled by one proposed parameter. &copy; 2010 IEEE.

Abstract:We provide a method for efficiently evaluating moves that complement values of 0-1 variables in search methods for binary unconstrained quadratic optimisation problems. Our method exploits a compact matrix representation and offers further improvements in speed by exploiting sparse matrices that arise in large-scale applications. The resulting approach, which works with integer or real data, can be applied to improve the efficiency of a variety of different search processes, especially in the case of commonly encountered applications that involve large and sparse matrices. It also enables larger problems to be solved than could previously be handled within a given amount of available memory. Our evaluation method has been embedded in a tabu search algorithm in a sequel to this paper, yielding a method that efficiently matches or improves currently best-known results for instances from widely used benchmark sets having up to 7,000 variables.

Abstract:In the Max Lin-2 problem we are given a system S of m linear equations in n variables over F<sub>2</sub> in which equation j is assigned a positive integral weight wj for each j. We wish to find an assignment of values to the variables which maximizes the total weight of satisfied equations. This problem generalizes Max Cut. The expected weight of satisfied equations is W/2, where W = w<sub>1</sub> + &hellip; + w<sub>m</sub>; W/2 is a tight lower bound on the optimal solution of Max Lin-2. Mahajan et al. (Parameterizing above or below guaranteed values, J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 75 (2009) 137-153) stated the following parameterized version of Max Lin-2: decide whether there is an assignment of values to the variables that satisfies equations of total weight at least W/2 + k, where k is the parameter. They asked whether this parameterized problem is fixed-parameter tractable, i.e., can be solved in time f(k)(nm)<sup>O(1)</sup>, where f(k) is an arbitrary computable function in k only. Their question remains open, but using some probabilistic inequalities and, in one case, a Fourier analysis inequality, Gutin et al. (A probabilistic approach to problems parameterized above tight lower bound, in: Proc. IWPEC'09, in: Lect. Notes Comput. Sci., vol. 5917, 2009, pp. 234-245) proved that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable in three special cases. In this paper we significantly extend two of the three special cases using only tools from combinatorics. We show that one of our results can be used to obtain a combinatorial proof that another problem from Mahajan et al. (Parameterizing above or below guaranteed values, J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 75 (2009) 137-153), Max r-SAT above Average, is fixed-parameter tractable for each r &ges; 2. Note that Max r-SAT above Average has been already shown to be fixed-parameter tractable by Alon et al. (Solving MAX-r-SAT above a tight lower bound, in: Proc. SODA 2010, pp. 511-517), but the paper used the approach of Gutin et al. (A probabilistic approach to problems parameterized above tight lower bound, in: Proc. IWPEC'09, in: Lect. Notes Comput. Sci., vol. 5917, 2009, pp. 234-245).[All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:Linear and semidefinite programming are highly successful approaches for obtaining good approximations for NP-hard optimization problems. For example, breakthrough approximation algorithms for Max Cut and Sparsest Cut use semidefinite programming. Perhaps the most prominent NP-hard problem whose exact approximation factor is still unresolved is Vertex Cover. Probabilistically checkable proof (PCP)-based techniques of Dinur and Safra [Ann. of Math. (2), 162 (2005), pp. 439-486] show that it is not possible to achieve a factor better than 1.36; on the other hand no known algorithm does better than the factor of 2 achieved by the simple greedy algorithm. There is a widespread belief that semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques are the most promising methods available for improving upon this factor of 2. Following a line of study initiated by Arora et al. [Theory Comput., 2 (2006), pp. 19-51], our aim is to show that a large family of linear programming (LP)- and SDP-based algorithms fail to produce an approximation for Vertex Cover better than 2. Lov&acute;asz and Schrijver [SIAM J. Optim., 1 (1991), pp. 166-190] introduced the systems LS and LS<inf>+</inf> for systematically tightening LP and SDP relaxations, respectively, over many rounds. These systems naturally capture large classes of LP and SDP relaxations; indeed, LS<inf>+</inf> captures the celebrated SDP-based algorithms for Max Cut and Sparsest Cut mentioned above. We rule out polynomial-time SDP-based 2 - &omega;(1) approximations for Vertex Cover using LS<inf>+</inf>. In particular, for every &isin; &gt; 0 we prove an integrality gap of 2 - &isin; for Vertex Cover SDPs obtained by tightening the standard LP relaxation with &omega;(&radic;log n/log log n) rounds of LS<inf>+</inf>. While tight integrality gaps were known for Vertex Cover in the weaker LS system [G. Schoenebeck, L. Trevisan, and M. Tulsiani, Proceedings of the 39th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM Press, New York, 2007, pp. 302-310], previous results did not rule out a 2 - &omega;(1) approximation after even two rounds of LS<inf>+</inf>. &copy; 2010 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

Abstract:We give a subexponential time approximation algorithm for the Unique Games problem. The algorithms run in time that is exponential in an arbitrarily small polynomial of the input size, n<sup>&Epsilon;</sup>. The approximation guarantee depends on &Epsilon;, but not on the alphabet size or the number of variables. We also obtain a subexponential algorithms with improved approximations for SMALL-SET EXPANSION and MULTICUT. For MAX CUT, SPARSEST CUT, and VERTEX COVER, we give subexponential algorithms with improved approximations on some interesting subclasses of instances. Khot's Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) states that it is NP-hard to achieve approximation guarantees such as ours for the Unique Games. While our results stop short of refuting the UGC, they do suggest that Unique Games is significantly easier than NP-hard problems such as MAX 3SAT, MAX 3LIN, LABEL COVER and more, that are believed not to have a subexponential algorithm achieving a non-trivial approximation ratio. The main component in our algorithms is a new result on graph decomposition that may have other applications. Namely we show that for every &Epsilon; &gt; 0 and every regular n-vertex graph G, by changing at most &Epsilon; fraction of G's edges, one can break G into disjoint parts so that the stochastic adjacency matrix of the induced graph on each part has at most n<sup>&Epsilon;</sup> eigenvalues larger than 1 - &eta;, where &eta; depends polynomially on &Epsilon;. &copy; 2010 IEEE.

Abstract:The hardcore model is a model of lattice gas systems which has received much attention in statistical physics, probability theory and theoretical computer science. It is the probability distribution over independent sets I of a graph weighted proportionally to &lambda;<sup>|I|</sup> with fugacity parameter &lambda;. We prove that at the uniqueness threshold of the hardcore model on the d-regular tree, approximating the partition function becomes computationally hard on graphs of maximum degree d. Specifically, we show that unless NP=RP there is no polynomial time approximation scheme for the partition function (the sum of such weighted independent sets) on graphs of maximum degree d for fugacity &lambda;<inf>c</inf>(d) &lt; &lambda; &lt; &lambda; <inf>c</inf>(d) + &Epsilon;(d) where &lambda;<inf>c</inf> = (d - 1) <sup>d-1</sup>/(d - 2)<sup>d</sup> is the uniqueness threshold on the d-regular tree and &Epsilon;(d) &gt; 0 is a positive constant. Weitz [36] produced an FPTAS for approximating the partition function when 0 &lt; &lambda; &lt; &lambda;<inf>c</inf>(d) so this result demonstrates that the computational threshold exactly coincides with the statistical physics phase transition thus confirming the main conjecture of [30]. We further analyze the special case of &lambda; = 1; d = 6 and show there is no polynomial time approximation scheme for approximately counting independent sets on graphs of maximum degree d = 6, which is optimal, improving the previous bound of d = 24. Our proof is based on specially constructed random bipartite graphs which act as gadgets in a reduction to MAX-CUT. Building on the involved second moment method analysis of [30] and combined with an analysis of the reconstruction problem on the tree our proof establishes a strong version of "replica" method heuristics developed by theoretical physicists. The result establishes the first rigorous correspondence between the hardness of approximate counting and sampling with statistical physics phase transitions. &copy; 2010 IEEE.

Abstract:Currently most existing image search engines such as Google Images index web images majorly using text keywords extracted from the context, which may return large amount of junk information. We propose a novel clustering based filtering method to filter those junk images. Firstly we apply K-way min-max cut to cluster images returned by Google into multiple clusters based on the mixture of feature kernels, with kernel weights being determined automatically instead of hard fix. Secondly we select the best cluster in a robust way, and rank all the rest clusters according to their similarity with the best one. Finally those low-rank clusters can be filtered out as junk clusters. In experiments we obtain very comparative filtering performance to the current state-of-the-art, and improve Google Images search results significantly. &copy; 2010 ACM.

Abstract:We consider graphs without loops or parallel edges in which every edge is assigned + or-. Such a signed graph is balanced if its vertex set can be partitioned into parts V <inf>1</inf> and V <inf>2</inf> such that all edges between vertices in the same part have sign + and all edges between vertices of different parts have sign-(one of the parts may be empty). It is well-known that every connected signed graph with n vertices and m edges has a balanced subgraph with at least edges and this bound is tight. We consider the following parameterized problem: given a connected signed graph G with n vertices and m edges, decide whether G has a balanced subgraph with at least edges, where k is the parameter. We obtain an algorithm for the problem of runtime 8 <sup>k</sup> (kn) <sup>O(1)</sup>. We also prove that for each instance (G,k) of the problem, in polynomial time, we can either solve (G,k) or produce an equivalent instance (G&prime;,k&prime;) such that k&prime; &le k and |V(G&prime;)| = O(k <sup>3</sup>). Our first result generalizes a result of Crowston, Jones and Mnich (ICALP 2012) on the corresponding parameterization of Max Cut (when every edge of G has sign-). Our second result generalizes and significantly improves the corresponding result of Crowston, Jones and Mnich for MaxCut: they showed that |V(G&prime;)| = O(k <sup>5</sup>). &copy; 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract:Submodular function maximization is a central problem in combinatorial optimization, generalizing many important NP-hard problems including max cut in digraphs, graphs, and hypergraphs; certain constraint satisfaction problems; maximum entropy sampling; and maximum facility location problems. Our main result is that for any k &ge; 2 and any &Epsilon; &gt; 0, there is a natural local search algorithm that has approximation guarantee of 1/(k + &Epsilon;) for the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to k matroid constraints. This improves upon the 1/(k + 1)-approximation of Fisher, Nemhauser, and Wolsey obtained in 1978 [Fisher, M., G. Nemhauser, L. Wolsey. 1978. An analysis of approximations for maximizing submodular set functions-II. Math. Programming Stud. 8 73-87]. Also, our analysis can be applied to the problem of maximizing a linear objective function and even a general nonmonotone submodular function subject to k matroid constraints. We show that, in these cases, the approximation guarantees of our algorithms are 1/(k - 1 + &Epsilon;) and 1/(k + 1 + 1/(k - 1) + &Epsilon;), respectively. Our analyses are based on two new exchange properties for matroids. One is a generalization of the classical Rota exchange property for matroid bases, and another is an exchange property for two matroids based on the structure of matroid intersection. &copy; 2010 INFORMS.

Abstract:A tanglegram consists of a pair of (not necessarily binary) trees. Additional edges, called tangles, may connect the leaves of the first with those of the second tree. The task is to draw a tanglegram with a minimum number of tangle crossings while making sure that the trees are drawn crossing-free. This problem has relevant applications in computational biology, e.g., for the comparison of phylogenetic trees. Most existing approaches are only applicable for binary trees. In this work, we show that the problem can be formulated as a quadratic linear ordering problem (QLO) with side constraints. Buchheim et al. (INFORMS J. Computing, to appear) showed that, appropriately reformulated, the QLO polytope is a face of some cut polytope. It turns out that the additional side constraints do not destroy this property. Therefore, any polyhedral approach to max-cut can be used in our context. We present experimental results for drawing random and real-world tanglegrams defined on both binary and general trees. We evaluate linear as well as semidefinite programming techniques. By extensive experiments, we show that our approach is very efficient in practice. &copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

Abstract:We improve the running time of the general algorithmic technique known as Baker's approach (1994) on H-minor-free graphs from O(n<sup>f(|H|)</sup>) to O(f(|H|)n<sup>O(1)</sup>). The numerous applications include, e.g. a 2-approximation for coloring and PTASes for various problems such as dominating set and max-cut, where we obtain similar improvements. On classes of odd-minor-free graphs, which have gained significant attention in recent time, we obtain a similar acceleration for a variant of the structural decomposition theorem proved by Demaine et al. (2010). We use these algorithms to derive faster 2-approximations; furthermore, we present the first PTASes and subexponential FPT-algorithms for independent set and vertex cover on these graph classes using a novel dynamic programming technique. We also introduce a technique to derive (nearly) subexponential parameterized algorithms on H-minor-free graphs. Our technique applies, in particular, to problems such as Steiner tree, (directed) subgraph with a property, (directed) longest path, and (connected/independent) dominating set, on some or all proper minor-closed graph classes. We obtain as a corollary that all problems with a minor-monotone subexponential kernel and amenable to our technique can be solved in subexponential FPT-time on H-minor free graphs. This results in a general methodology for subexponential parameterized algorithms outside the framework of bidimensionality. &copy; 2010 Springer-Verlag.

It is a very important issue that how to get the optimal solution of SVM model. In this paper, a new solution method is proposed. The constraints are moved away from the original optimization model by using the approximation solution in the feasible space. Three points under one control parameter smoothing function is used to smoothen the objective function of unconstrained model. It is a sixth order polynomial function. The smoothing performance is investigated. By theory proof, the proposed unconstrained model has an active performance which can be controlled by one proposed parameter. &copy; 2010 IEEE.

Abstract:Accurate phylogenetic reconstruction methods are currently limited to a maximum of few dozens of taxa. Supertree methods construct a large tree over a large set of taxa, from a set of small trees over overlapping subsets of the complete taxa set. Hence, in order to construct the tree of life over a million and a half different species, the use of a supertree method over the product of accurate methods, is inevitable. Perhaps the simplest version of this task that is still widely applicable, yet quite challenging, is quartet-based reconstruction. This problem lies at the root of many tree reconstruction methods and theoretical as well as experimental results have been reported. Nevertheless, dealing with false, conflicting quartet trees remains problematic. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for constructing a tree from a set of input quartet trees even with a significant fraction of errors. We show empirically that conflicts in the inputs are handled satisfactorily and that it significantly outperforms and outraces the Matrix Representation with Parsimony (MRP) methods that have previously been most successful in dealing with supertrees. Our algorithm is based on a divide and conquer algorithm where our divide step uses a semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation of MaxCut. We remark that this builds on previous work of ours [29] for piecing together trees from rooted triplet trees. The recursion for unrooted quartets, however, is more complicated in that even with completely consistent set of quartet trees the problem is NP-hard, as opposed to the problem for triples where there is a linear time algorithm. This complexity leads to several issues and some solutions of possible independent interest. &copy; 2006 IEEE.

Abstract:This paper describes a Diversification-Driven Tabu Search (D<sup>2</sup>TS) algorithm for solving unconstrained binary quadratic problems. D<sup>2</sup>TS is distinguished by the introduction of a perturbation-based diversification strategy guided by long-term memory. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed on the largest instances from the ORLIB library (up to 2500 variables) as well as still larger instances from the literature (up to 7000 variables). The computational results show that D<sup>2</sup>TS is highly competitive in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency relative to some of the best performing heuristics in the literature.

Abstract:Full human genomic sequences have been published in the latest two years for a growing number of individuals. Most of them are a mixed consensus of the two real haplotypes because it is still very expensive to separate information coming from the two copies of a chromosome. However, latest improvements and new experimental approaches promise to solve these issues and provide enough information to reconstruct the sequences for the two copies of each chromosome through bioinformatics methods such as single individual haplotyping. Full haploid sequences provide a complete understanding of the structure of the human genome, allowing accurate predictions of translation in protein coding regions and increasing power of association studies. In this paper we present a novel problem formulation for single individual haplotyping. We start by assigning a score to each pair of fragments based on their common allele calls and then we use these score to formulate the problem as the cut of fragments that maximize an objective function, similar to the well known max-cut problem. Our algorithm initially finds the best cut based on a heuristic algorithm for max-cut and then builds haplotypes consistent with that cut. We have compared both accuracy and running time of ReFHap with other heuristic methods on both simulated and real data and found that ReFHap performs significantly faster than previous methods without loss of accuracy.

Abstract:This paper addresses a new continuous approach based on the DC (Difference of Convex functions) programming and DC algorithms (DCA) to Binary quadratic programs (BQP) which play a key role in combinatorial optimization. DCA is completely different from other avalaible methods and featured by generating a convergent finite sequence of feasible binary solutions (obtained by solving linear programs with the same constraint set) with decreasing objective values. DCA is quite simple and inexpensive to handle large-scale problems. In particular DCA is explicit, requiring only matrix-vector products for Unconstrained Binary quadratic programs (UBQP), and can then exploit sparsity in the large-scale setting. To check globality of solutions computed by DCA, we introduce its combination with a customized Branch-and-Bound scheme using DC/SDP relaxation. The combined algorithm allows checking globality of solutions computed by DCA and restarting it if necessary and consequently accelerates the B&amp;B approach. Numerical results on several series test problems provided in OR-Library (Beasley in J Global Optim, 8:429-433, 1996), show the robustness and efficiency of our algorithm with respect to standard methods. In particular DCA provides &Epsilon;-optimal solutions in almost all cases after only one restarting and the combined DCA-B&amp;B-SDP always provides (&Epsilon;-)optimal solutions. &copy; 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Abstract:An example of how circuit related techniques can help solving optimisatin problems originating from completely different domains is provided. It is shown that a specific class of Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming (UBQP) problems, including those arising in the optimisation of flutter control via blade mistuning, can be solved by means of &Delta;&Sigma; modulators. This is done in steps, first restating the UBQP problem as a specific signal processing problem, and then attacking the latter via the design of a &Delta;&Sigma; modulator with a suitably derived Noise Transfer Function. A (heuristically) optimal solution for the original problem is finally obtained from the modulator output stream. The method is validated by two numerical examples arising in the design of turbo-machines. &copy;2010 IEEE.

Abstract:A novel web image annotation method by candidate annotations clustering and parallel graph bipartition is proposed in this paper. Firstly, surrounding texts and other textual information in the hosting pages are extracted as the candidate annotations. For Web images, the candidate annotation sets of which are usually fairly large. Therefore, we cluster candidate annotations to reduce computation complexity. Next, centroids of clustering results and the distance between them are used to construct a graph. Then a parallel 0.87856 heuristics MAX-CUT algorithm is applied to partition the graph. Finally, one part of the graph partition results is selected as final annotation results. Experimental results show that our method works more effectively than existing methods. &copy; 2010 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

Abstract:In many practical applications, the task is to optimize a non-linear objective function over the vertices of a well-studied polytope as, e.g., the matching polytope or the travelling salesman polytope (TSP). Prominent examples are the quadratic assignment problem and the quadratic knapsack problem; further applications occur in various areas such as production planning or automatic graph drawing. In order to apply branch-and-cut methods for the exact solution of such problems, the objective function has to be linearized. However, the standard linearization usually leads to very weak relaxations. On the other hand, problem-specific polyhedral studies are often time-consuming. Our goal is the design of general separation routines that can replace detailed polyhedral studies of the resulting polytope and that can be used as a black box. As unconstrained binary quadratic optimization is equivalent to the maximum-cut problem, knowledge about cut polytopes can be used in our setting. Other separation routines are inspired by the local cuts that have been developed by Applegate, Bixby, Chva&acute;tal and Cook for faster solution of large-scale traveling salesman instances. Finally, we apply quadratic reformulations of the linear constraints as proposed by Helmberg, Rendl and Weismantel for the quadratic knapsack problem. By extensive experiments, we show that a suitable combination of these methods leads to a drastic speedup in the solution of constrained quadratic 0-1 problems. We also discuss possible generalizations of these methods to arbitrary non-linear objective functions. &copy; 2010 Springer and Mathematical Programming Society.

Abstract:This paper presents a discrete Hopfield neural network (DHNN) combined with estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) for Max-Cut problem. In order to overcome the local minima problem of the DHNN, the idea of EDA is combined with the DHNN. Once the network is trapped in local minima, the perturbation based on EDA can generate a new starting point for the DHNN for further search, which is in a promising area characterized by a probability model. Thus, the proposed algorithm can escape from local minima and further search better results. Simulation results on the Max-Cut problem show that the proposed algorithm is better or competitive with heuristic algorithms such as the multi-start DHNN, HCE, CirCut, GPR and VNSPR.

Abstract:While Spectral Methods have long been used for Principal Component Analysis, this survey focusses on work over the last 15 years with three salient features: (i) Spectral methods are useful not only for numerical problems, but also discrete optimization problems (Constraint Optimization Problems - CSP's) like the max. cut problem and similar mathematical considerations underlie both areas. (ii) Spectral methods can be extended to tensors. The theory and algorithms for tensors are not as simple/clean as for matrices, but the survey describes methods for low-rank approximation which extend to tensors. These tensor approximations help us solve Max-r-CSP's for r&gt;2 as well as numerical tensor problems. (iii) Sampling on the fly plays a prominent role in these methods. A primary result is that for any matrix, a random submatrix of rows/columns picked with probabilities proportional to the squared lengths (of rows/columns), yields estimates of the singular values as well as an approximation to the whole matrix. &copy; 2010 ACM.

Abstract:We establish the existence of free energy limits for several sparse random hypergraph models corresponding to certain combinatorial models on Erdo&die;s-Re&acute;nyi graph double-struck G(N,c/N) and random r-regular graph double-struck G(N,r). For a variety of models, including independent sets, MAX-CUT, Coloring and K-SAT, we prove that the free energy both at a positive and zero temperature, appropriately rescaled, converges to a limit as the size of the underlying graph diverges to infinity. In the zero temperature case, this is interpreted as the existence of the scaling limit for the corresponding combinatorial optimization problem. For example, as a special case we prove that the size of a largest independent set in these graphs, normalized by the number of nodes converges to a limit w.h.p., thus resolving an open problem, (see Conjecture 2.20 in Wormald's Random Graph Models, or Aldous's list of open problems. Our approach is based on extending and simplifying the interpolation method of Guerra and Toninelli. Among other applications, this method was used to prove the existence of free energy limits for Viana-Bray and K-SAT models on ER graphs. The case of zero temperature was treated by taking limits of positive temperature models. We provide instead a simpler combinatorial approach and work with the zero temperature case (optimization) directly both in the case of Erdo&die;s-Re&acute;nyi graph double-struck G(N,c/N) and random regular graph double-struck G(N,r). In addition we establish the large deviations principle for the satisfiability property for constraint satisfaction problems such as Coloring, K-SAT and NAE-K-SAT. For example, let p(c, q,N) and p(r, q,N) denote, respectively, the probability that random graphs double-struck G(N, c/N) and double-struck G(N, r) are properly q-colorable. We prove the existence of limits of N<sup>-1</sup> log p(c, q,N) and N<sup>-1</sup> log p(r, q,N), as N &rarr &infin;. &copy; 2010 ACM.

Abstract:A novel web image annotation framework by graph cutting and web mining is presented in this paper. Firstly, initial annotations are extracted from surrounding texts and other textual information in the hosting pages. As these initial annotations are noisy, a graph cutting algorithm is applied to prune noisy annotations. Initial annotation is represented as vertex of a graph and the WordNet based semantic similarity between two initial annotations is used to construct edge weight. To make the annotation results more objective, the relevance between initial annotation and image visual features is also considered. Next, we run a heuristics MAX-CUT algorithm to obtain final annotations. Experimental results show that our Web image annotation framework works more effectively than other state-of-the-art methods.

We introduce a technique of constructing instances which enforce certain sequences of improving steps. Using our technique we can show that already graphs with maximum degree four satify the following two properties. 1 There are instances with initial solutions for which every local search takes exponential time to converge to a local optimum. 1 The problem of computing a local optimum reachable from a given solution by a sequence of improving steps is PSPACE-complete. Scha&die;ffer and Yannakakis (JOC '91) showed via a so called "tight" PLS-reduction that the properties (1) and (2) hold for graphs with unbounded degree. Our improvement to the degree four is the best possible improvement since Poljak (JOC '95) showed for cubic graphs that every sequence of improving steps has polynomial length, whereby his result is easily generalizable to arbitrary graphs with maximum degree three. In his paper Poljak also asked whether (1) holds for graphs with maximum degree four, which is settled by our result. Many tight PLS-reductions in the literature are based on the max-cut problem. Via some of them our constructions carry over to other problems and show that the properties (1) and (2) already hold for very restricted sets of feasible inputs of these problems. Since our paper provides the two results that typically come along with tight PLS-reductions it does naturally put the focus on the question whether it is even PLS-complete to compute a local optimum on graphs with maximum degree four - a question that was recently asked by Ackermann et al. We think that our insights might be helpful for tackling this question. &copy; 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract:We deal with two intimately related subjects: quasi-randomness and regular partitions. The purpose of the concept of quasi-randomness is to express how much a given graph "resembles" a random one. Moreover, a regular partition approximates a given graph by a bounded number of quasi-random graphs. Regarding quasi-randomness, we present a new spectral characterization of low discrepancy, which extends to sparse graphs. Concerning regular partitions, we introduce a concept of regularity that takes into account vertex weights, and show that if G = (V, E) satisfies a certain boundedness condition, then G admits a regular partition. In addition, building on the work of Alon and Naor [Proceedings of the 36th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), Chicago, IL, ACM, New York, 2004, pp. 72-80], we provide an algorithm that computes a regular partition of a given (possibly sparse) graph G in polynomial time. As an application, we present a polynomial time approximation scheme for MAX CUT on (sparse) graphs without "dense spots".

Abstract:We continue the recent line of work on the connection between semidefinite programming (SDP)-based approximation algorithms and the unique games conjecture. Given any Boolean 2-CSP (or, more generally, any Boolean 2-CSP with real-valued "predicates"), we show how to reduce the search for a good inapproximability result to a certain numeric minimization problem. Furthermore, we give an SDP-based approximation algorithm and show that the approximation ratio of this algorithm on a certain restricted type of instances is exactly the inapproximability ratio yielded by our hardness result. We conjecture that the restricted type required for the hardness result is in fact no restriction, which would imply that these upper and lower bounds match exactly. This conjecture is supported by all existing results for specific 2-CSPs. As an application, we show that MAX 2-AND is unique games-hard to approximate within 0.87435. This improves upon the best previous hardness of &alpha;<sub>GW</sub> + &isin; &ap; 0.87856 and comes very close to matching the approximation ratio of the best algorithm known, 0.87401. It also establishes that balanced instances of MAX 2-AND, i.e., instances in which each variable occurs positively and negatively equally often, are not the hardest to approximate, as these can be approximated within a factor &alpha;<sub>GW</sub> and that MAX Cut is not the hardest 2-CSP.

Abstract:Unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem (UBQP) consists in maximizing a quadratic 0-1 function. It is a well known NP-hard problem and is a unified model for a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. This paper presents a discrete Hopfield neural network (DHNN) combined with estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) for the UBQP. The idea of EDA is combined with the DHNN in order to overcome the local minima problem of the network. Once the network is trapped in local minima, the perturbation based on EDA can generate a new starting point for the DHNN for further search, which is in a promising area characterized by a probability model. Thus, the proposed algorithm, named DHNN-EDA, can escape from local minima and further search better results. The DHNN-EDA is tested on a large number of benchmark problems with size up to 7000 variables. Simulation results on the UBQP show that the DHNN-EDA is better than the other improved DHNN algorithms such as multi-start DHNN and DHNN with random flips, and is better than or competitive with metaheuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing, tabu search, scatter search and memetic algorithm.

Abstract:We present a multi-parent hybrid genetic-tabu algorithm (denoted by GTA) for the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming (UBQP) problem, by incorporating tabu search into the framework of genetic algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new multi-parent combination operator for generating offspring solutions. A pool updating strategy based on a quality-and-distance criterion is used to manage the population. Experimental comparisons with leading methods for the UBQP problem on 25 large public instances demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. &copy; 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract:Many NP-hard problems can be solved efficiently when the input is restricted to graphs of bounded tree-width or clique-width. In particular, by the celebrated result of Courcelle, every decision problem expressible in monadic second order logic is fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by the tree-width of the input graph. On the other hand if we restrict ourselves to graphs of clique-width at most t, then there are many natural problems for which the running time of the best known algorithms is of the form n <sup>f(t)</sup>, where n is the input length and f is some function. It was an open question whether natural problems like GRAPH COLORING, MAX-CUT, EDGE DOMINATING SET, and HAMILTONIAN PATH are fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by the clique-width of the input graph. As a first step toward obtaining lower bounds for clique-width parameterizations, in [SODA 2009], we showed that unless FPT&ne;W[1], there is no algorithm with run time O(g(t)&middotn<sup>c</sup>), for some function g and a constant c not depending on t, for GRAPH COLORING, EDGE DOMINATING SET and HAMILTONIAN PATH. But the lower bounds obtained in [SODA 2009] are weak when compared to the upper bounds on the time complexity of the known algorithms for these problems when parameterized by the clique-width. In this paper, we obtain the asymptotically tight bounds for MAX-CUT and EDGE DOMINATING SET by showing that both problems &bull cannot be solved in time f(t)n<sup>o(t)</sup>, unless Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) collapses; and &bull can be solved in time n<sup>O(t)</sup>, where f is an arbitrary function of t, on input of size n and clique-width at most t. We obtain our lower bounds by giving non-trivial structure-preserving "linear FPT reductions". Copyright &copy; by SIAM.

Abstract:The class of constraint satisfactions problems (CSPs) captures many fundamental combinatorial optimization problems such as MAX CUT, MAX q-CUT, UNIQUE GAMES, and MAX k-SAT. Recently, Raghavendra (STOC'08) identified a simple semidefinite programming relaxation that gives the best possible approximation for any CSP, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. Raghavendra and Steurer (FOCS'09) showed that, independent of the truth of the Unique Games Conjecture, the integrality gap of this relaxation cannot be improved even by adding a large class of valid inequalities. We present an algorithm that finds an approximately optimal solution to this relaxation in near-linear time. Combining this algorithm with a rounding scheme of Raghavendra and Steurer (FOCS'09) leads to an approximation algorithm for any CSP that runs in near-linear time and has an approximation guarantee that matches the integrality gap, which is optimal assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.

Abstract:Despite the many advantages of interior-point algorithms over active-set methods for linear optimization, one of the remaining practical challenges is their current limitation to efficiently solve series of related problems by an effective warmstarting strategy. As a remedy, in this paper we present a new infeasible-interior-point approach to quickly reoptimize an initial problem instance after data perturbations, or a new linear programming relaxation after adding cutting planes for discrete or combinatorial problems. Based on the detailed complexity analysis of the underlying algorithm, we perform a comparative analysis to coldstart initialization schemes and present encouraging computational results with iteration savings of around 50% on average for perturbations of the Netlib linear programs (LPs) and successive linear programming relaxations of max-cut and the traveling salesman problem.

Abstract:Recently, images on the Web and personal computers are prevalent around the human's life. To retrieve effectively these images, there are many (Automatic Image Annotation) AIA algorithms. However, it still suffers from low-level accuracy since it couldn't overcome the semantic-gap between low-level features ('color', 'texture' and 'shape') and high-level semantic meanings (e.g., 'sky', 'beach'). Namely, AIA techniques annotates images with many noisy keywords. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that augments the classical model with generic knowledge-based, WordNet. Our novel approach strives to prune irrelevant keywords by the usage of WordNet. To identify irrelevant keywords, we investigate various semantic similarity measures between keywords and finally fuse outcomes of all these measures together to make a final decision using Dempster-Shafer evidence combination. Furthermore, We can re-formulate the removal of erroneous keywords from image annotation problem into graph-partitioning problem, which is weighted MAX-CUT problem. It is possible that we have too many candidate keywords for web-images. Hence, we need to have deterministic polynomial time algorithm for MAX-CUT problem. We show that finding optimal solution for removing noisy keywords in the graph is NP-Complete problem and propose a new methodology for Knowledge Based Image Annotation Refinement (KBIAR) using a deterministic polynomial time algorithm, namely, randomized approximation graph algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of this algorithm over traditional one including the most recent work for a benchmark dataset. &copy; 2009 The Author(s).

Abstract:Submodular function maximization is a central problem in combinatorial optimization, generalizing many important problems including max cut in directed/undirected graphs and in hypergraphs, certain constraint satisfaction problems, maximum entropy sampling, and maximum facility location problems. Unlike submodular minimization, submodular maximization is NP-hard. In this paper, we give the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for maximizing any nonnegative submodular function subject to multiple matroid or knapsack constraints. We emphasize that our results are for nonmonotone submodular functions. In particular, for any constant k, we present a (1/k+2+1/k+&epsi;)-approximation for the submodular maximization problem under k matroid constraints, and a (1/5 - &epsi;)-approximation algorithm for this problem subject to k knapsack constraints (&epsi; &gt; 0 is any constant). We improve the approximation guarantee of our algorithm to 1/(k+1+1/(k-1)+&epsi;) for k &ges; 2 partition matroid constraints. This idea also gives a (1/(k+&epsi;))-approximation for maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to k &ges; 2 partition matroids, which is an improvement over the previously best known guarantee of 1/(k+1).

Abstract:We establish that the min-sum message-passing algorithm and its asynchronous variants converge for a large class of unconstrained convex optimization problems, generalizing existing results for pairwise quadratic optimization problems. The main sufficient condition is that of scaled diagonal dominance. This condition is similar to known sufficient conditions for asynchronous convergence of other decentralized optimization algorithms, such as coordinate descent and gradient descent. &copy; 2006 IEEE.

Abstract:Given a bipartite graph G=(V, E), a weight for each node, and a weight for each edge, we consider an extension of the MAX-CUT problem that consists in searching for a partition of V into two subsets V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> such that the sum of the weights of the edges from E that have one endpoint in each set plus the sum of the weights of the nodes from V that are in V<sub>1</sub>, is maximal. We prove that this problem can be modeled as a linear program (with real variables) and therefore efficiently solved by standard algorithms. Then, we show how this result can be applied to model a land allocation problem by a 0-1 linear program. This problem consists in determining the cells of a land area, divided into a matrix of identical square cells, which must be harvested and the cells which must be left in old growth so that the weighted sum of the expected populations of some species is maximized. Some computational results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the method. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:In this paper we study the problem of upper bounding the probability that a random variable is above its expected value by a small amount (relative to the expected value), by means of the second and the fourth (central) moments of the random variable. In this particular context, many classical inequalities yield only trivial bounds. We obtain tight upper bounds by studying the primal-dual moments-generating conic optimization problems. As an application, we demonstrate that given the new probability bounds, a substantial sharpening and simplification of a recent result and its analysis by Feige (see Feige, U. 2006. On sums of independent random variables with unbounded variances, and estimating the average degree in a graph. SIAM J. Comput. 35 964-984) can be obtained; also, these bounds lead to new properties of the distribution of the cut values for the max-cut problem. We expect the new probability bounds to be useful in many other applications. &copy; 2010 INFORMS.

Abstract:The maximum cut (Max-Cut) problem has extensive applications in various real-world fields, such as network design and statistical physics. In this paper, a more practical version, the Max-Cut problem with fuzzy coefficients, is discussed. Specifically, based on credibility theory, the Max-Cut problem with fuzzy coefficients is formulated as an expected value model, a chance-constrained programming model and a dependent-chance programming model respectively according to different decision criteria. When these fuzzy coefficients are represented by special fuzzy variables like triangular fuzzy numbers and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, the crisp equivalents of the fuzzy Max-Cut problem can be obtained. Finally, a genetic algorithm combined with fuzzy simulation techniques is designed for the general fuzzy Max-Cut problem under these models and numerical experiment confirms the effectiveness of the designed genetic algorithm. &copy; 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Many local search algorithms are based on searching in the k-exchange neighborhood. This is the set of solutions that can be obtained from the current solution by exchanging at most k elements. As a rule of thumb, the larger k is, the better are the chances of finding an improved solution. However, for inputs of size n, a nai&die;ve brute-force search of the k-exchange neighborhood requires n<sup>O(k)</sup> time, which is not practical even for very small values of k. We show that for several classes of sparse graphs, like planar graphs, graphs of bounded vertex degree and graphs excluding some fixed graph as a minor, an improved solution in the k-exchange neighborhood for many problems can be found much more efficiently. Our algorithms run in time O(&tau; (k) &bull n<sup>c</sup>), where &tau; is a function depending on k only and c is a constant independent of k. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach on different problems like r-CENTER, VERTEX COVER, ODD CYCLE TRANSVERSAL, MAX-CUT, andMIN-BISECTION. In particular, on planar graphs, all our algorithms searching for a k-local improvement run in time O(2<sup>O(k)</sup> &bulln<sup>2</sup>), which is polynomial for k = O(log n). We also complement the algorithms with complexity results indicating that - brute force search is unavoidable - in more general classes of sparse graphs.

Abstract:Cross Entropy method has recently been proposed as a heuristic method. lt shows some simple performance in the process, of solving combinatorial optimization problems. This paper makes full use of Cross Entropy method to obtain the best estimator for the max-cut problem which is a standard NP-hard problem in graph graphic theory. The proposed algorithm employs an auxiliary Bernoulli distribution, which transforms the original deterministic network into an associated stochastic one. Random samples can be generated by using a multidimensional Ber (p) distribution. Meanwhile, some random cuts can be gotten. The next step is to update the parameter vector p on the basis of the data collected in the first phase. The exact estimator of the maximal cut can be obtained. Numerical studies suggest that for the maximal cut the proposed algorithm has much better performance in convergence speed and stability. Moreover, the good solutions are found.

Abstract:Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE) are two latest optimization techniques. These algorithms have been very successful in solving the global continuous optimization, but their applications to combinatorial optimization have been rather limited and are not as effective as in global continuous optimization. Recently, a Differential Barebones PSO (DBPSO) is also proposed for global continuous optimization. Firstly, a discrete DBPSO is proposed for combinatorial optimization, and then the Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) is incorporated into the discrete DBPSO to improve its performance. The proposed discrete DBPSO algorithm based on EDA combines global statistical information extracted by EDA with local evolution information obtained by discrete DBPSO to create promising solutions. The results of experiment show that the EDA can significantly improve the performance of the discrete DBPSO.

Abstract:This paper deals with two games defined upon well known generalizations of MAX CUT. We study the existence of a strong equilibrium which is a refinement of the Nash equilibrium. Bounds on the price of anarchy for Nash equilibria and strong equilibria are also given. In particular, we show that the MAX CUT game always admits a strong equilibrium and the strong price of anarchy is 2/3.

Abstract:A large number of interesting combinatorial optimization problems like MAX CUT, MAX k-SAT, and UNIQUE GAMES fall under the class of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Recent work [32] by one of the authors identifies a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation that yields the optimal approximation ratio for every CSP, under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). Very recently [33], the authors also showed unconditionally that the integrality gap of this basic SDP relaxation cannot be reduced by adding large classes of valid inequalities (e.g., in the fashion of Sherali-Adams LP hierarchies). In this work, we present an efficient rounding scheme that achieves the integrality gap of this basic SDP relaxation for every CSP (and by [33] it also achieves the gap of much stronger SDP relaxations). The SDP relaxation we consider is stronger or equivalent to any relaxation used in literature to approximate CSPs. Thus, irrespective of the truth of the UGC, our work yields an efficient generic algorithm that for every CSP, achieves an approximation at least as good as the best known algorithm in literature. The rounding algorithm in this paper can be summarized succinctly as follows: Reduce the dimension of SDP solution by random projection, discretize the projected vectors, and solve the resulting CSP instance by brute force! Even the proof is simple in that it avoids the use of the machinery from unique games reductions such as dictatorship tests, Fourier analysis or the invariance principle. A common theme of this paper and the subsequent paper [33] is a robustness lemma for SDP relaxations which asserts that approximately feasible solutions can be made feasible by "smoothing" without changing the objective value significantly. &copy; 2009 IEEE.

Abstract:Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems concern the minimization of quadratic polynomials in n{0,1}-valued variables. These problems are NP-complete, but prior work has identified a sequence of polynomial-time computable lower bounds on the minimum value, denoted by C<sub>2</sub>,C<sub>3</sub>,C<sub>4</sub>,.... It is known that C<sub>2</sub> can be computed by solving a maximum flow problem, whereas the only previously known algorithms for computing C<sub>k</sub> (k &gt; 2) require solving a linear program. In this paper we prove that C<sub>3</sub> can be computed by solving a maximum multicommodity flow problem in a graph constructed from the quadratic function. In addition to providing a lower bound on the minimum value of the quadratic function on {0,1}<sup>n</sup>, this multicommodity flow problem also provides some information about the coordinates of the point where this minimum is achieved. By looking at the edges that are never saturated in any maximum multicommodity flow, we can identify relational persistencies: pairs of variables that must have the same or different values in any minimizing assignment. We furthermore show that all of these persistencies can be detected by solving single-commodity flow problems in the same network. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:In wireless networks, mutual interference prevents wireless devices from correctly receiving packages from others and becomes one of the challenges in the design of protocols for wireless networks. Spatial-reuse Time Division Multiple Access (STDMA) has been used to cope with this problem. In this scheme, links are assigned to several time slots and in each slot all the links can transmit simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a greedy link scheduling algorithm to find a short schedule for a problem instance in the physical interference model. Our scheduling algorithm is inspired by the k-MAX-CUT algorithm in [13]. Experimental results show that our greedy algorithm can give a better schedule compared with the greedy algorithm in [3], with an improvement about 20%-30% when the density of links is high.

Abstract:A continuous approach using NCP function for approximating the solution of the max-cut . problem is proposed. The max-cut problem is relaxed into an equivalent nonlinearly constrained continuous optimization problem and a feasible direction method without line searches is presented for generating an optimal solution of the relaxed continuous optimization problem. The convergence of the algorithm is proved. Numerical experiments and comparisons on some max-cut test problems show that we can get the satisfactory solution of max-cut problems with less computation time. Furthermore, this is the first time that the feasible direction method is combined with NCP function for solving max-cut problem, and similar idea can be generalized to other combinatorial optimization problems.

Abstract:A graph homomorphism is a vertex map which carries edges from a source graph to edges in a target graph. We study the approximability properties of the weighted maximum H-colourable subgraph problem (MAX H-COL). The instances of this problem are edge-weighted graphs G and the objective is to find a subgraph of G that has maximal total edge weight, under the condition that the subgraph has a homomorphism to H; note that for H = K<sub>k</sub> this problem is equivalent to max k-CUT. To this end, we introduce a metric structure on the space of graphs which allows us to extend previously known approximability results to larger classes of graphs. Specifically, the approximation algorithms for max CUT by Goemans and Williamson and max k-CUT by Frieze and Jerrum can be used to yield non-trivial approximation results for max H-col. For a variety of graphs, we show near-optimality results under the unique games conjecture. We also use our method for comparing the performance of Frieze &amp; Jerrum's algorithm with Hastad's approximation algorithm for general Max 2CSP. This comparison is, in most cases, favourable to Frieze &amp; Jerrum.

Abstract:We show, by a non-trivial application of the color-coding method of Alon et al., that budgeted unique coverage (a variant of set cover) is fixed-parameter tractable, answering an open problem posed in. We also give improved fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for two special cases of budgeted unique coverage: unique coverage (the unweighted version) and budgeted max CUT. To derandomize our algorithms we use an interesting variation of k-perfect hash families known as (k, s)-hash families which were studied by Alon et al. in the context of a class of codes called parent identifying codes. In this setting, for every s-element subset S of the universe, and every k-element subset X of S, there exists a function that maps X injectively and maps the remaining elements of S into a different range. We give several bounds on the size of (k, s)-hash families. We believe that our application of color-coding may be used for other problems and that this is the first application of (k, s)-hash families to a problem outside the domain of coding theory.

Abstract:An instance of the maximum constraint satisfaction problem (Max CSP) is a finite collection of constraints on a set of variables, and the goal is to assign values to the variables that maximises the number of satisfied constraints. Max CSP captures many well-known problems (such as Maxk-SAT and Max Cut) and is consequently NP-hard. Thus, it is natural to study how restrictions on the allowed constraint types (or constraint language) affect the complexity and approximability of Max CSP. The PCP theorem is equivalent to the existence of a constraint language for which Max CSP has a hard gap at location 1; i.e. it is NP-hard to distinguish between satisfiable instances and instances where at most some constant fraction of the constraints are satisfiable. All constraint languages, for which the CSP problem (i.e., the problem of deciding whether all constraints can be satisfied) is currently known to be NP-hard, have a certain algebraic property. We prove that any constraint language with this algebraic property makes Max CSP have a hard gap at location 1 which, in particular, implies that such problems cannot have a PTAS unless P=NP. We then apply this result to Max CSP restricted to a single constraint type; this class of problems contains, for instance, Max Cut and Max DiCut. Assuming P&ne;NP, we show that such problems do not admit PTAS except in some trivial cases. Our results hold even if the number of occurrences of each variable is bounded by a constant. Finally, we give some applications of our results. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:Based on the analysis of the realizing process of spectral clustering and the existing algorithms, three typical spectral clustering methods, such as normalized cut, Min-max cut and automatic determination the number of clusters, were selected to discuss. The respective realization mechanism and clustering features were analyzed, and the experiment results of UCI (University of California, Irvine) data sets were compared. The research results show the clustering validity of the three algorithms and indicate the effect of threshold parameter and similarity measurement on performance of algorithms. Based on this, the feasible thoughts of spectral clustering to solve practical problems were introduced. That may be reference for engineering practice.

Abstract:A novel graph-based approach to automatically refine image annotation is presented in this paper. Given an unannotated image, a set of candidate annotations is extracted by the existing image annotation method. Then, each candidate annotation is converted to vertex of a graph and the semantic similarity between two candidate annotations is used as edge weight. Next, a heuristics graph algorithm solving weighted MAX-CUT problem is used to prune the noisy annotations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our image annotation refinement algorithm. &copy; 2009 Crown Copyright.

Abstract:We propose a framework on developing a decision support tool for emergency management planning. This framework involves development of innovative dynamic risk and uncertainty analysis methods known as quality function deployment. Instead of simply computing the weight of emergency planning criteria, we used rule-based expert system to handle the interdependency among the criteria. The expert system with composite rules is encoded into a Boolean satisfiability problem, which can be solved by a quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation method. We also discuss the approach based on the use of the visualisation tools by integrating with GIS and other information support systems. In this respect, this proposed approach completely changes the current practice of emergency management planning.

Abstract:The Max-Cut problem consists of partitioning the nodes of an undirected weighted graph into two subsets, such that the sum of the weights of the edges that connect two vertices in different partitions is maximized. It has applications in several fields like statistical physics, VLSI design, among others, and is known to be NP-Hard. We propose a Neighborhood generation method that balances diversity and quality of the obtained solutions. Consequently, the inclusion within Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search frameworks produces similar results to those reported by state-of-the-art methods such as VNSPR and Scatter Search, and in some cases improves them.

Abstract:This paper expands the list of 0-1 problems that can be effectively modelled and solved as Unconstrained Quadratic Binary Programs (UQPs). UQP has been presented as a general-purpose modelling approach with application to a broad range of problem classes (Kochenberger et al., 2004). In this paper, we demonstrate that the Linear Ordering Problem (LOP) can be easily recast so that it can be treated as a UQP problem, and that large instances of the LOP can be effectively handled within this framework. Computational results are given demonstrating the viability and attractiveness of this approach.

Abstract:Submodular function maximization is a central problem in combinatorial optimization, generalizing many important problems including Max Cut in directed/undirected graphs and in hypergraphs, certain constraint satisfaction problems, maximum entropy sampling, and maximum facility location problems. Unlike submodular minimization, submodular maximization is NP-hard. In this paper, we give the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for maximizing any non-negative submodular function subject to multiple matroid or knapsack constraints. We emphasize that our results are for non-monotone submodular functions. In particular, for any constant k, we present a ( 1/k+2+1/k +&Epsilon;)-approximation for the submodular maximization problem under k matroid constraints, and a (1/5 - &Epsilon;)-approximation algorithm for this problem subject to k knapsack constraints (&Epsilon; &gt; 0 is any constant). We improve the approximation guarantee of our algorithm to 1/k+1+1/k-1+&Epsilon; for k &ge; 2 partition matroid constraints. This idea also gives a ( 1/k+&Epsilon;)- approximation for maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to k &ge; 2 partition matroids, which improves over the previously best known guarantee of 1/k+1.

Abstract:We prove strong lower bounds on integrality gaps of Sherali- Adams relaxations for MAX CUT, Vertex Cover, Sparsest Cut and other problems. Our constructions show gaps for Sherali-Adams relaxations that survive rounds of lift and project. For MAX CUT and Vertex Cover, these show that even n <sup>&delta;</sup> rounds of Sherali-Adams do not yield a better than 2 - &Epsilon; approximation. The main combinatorial challenge in constructing these gap examples is the construction of a fractional solution that is far from an integer solution, but yet admits consistent distributions of local solutions for all small subsets of variables. Satisfying this consistency requirement is one of the major hurdles to constructing Sherali-Adams gap examples. We present a modular recipe for achieving this, building on previous work on metrics with a local-global structure. We develop a conceptually simple geometric approach to constructing Sherali-Adams gap examples via constructions of consistent local SDP solutions. This geometric approach is surprisingly versatile. We construct Sherali-Adams gap examples for Unique Games based on our construction for MAX CUT together with a parallel repetition like procedure. This in turn allows us to obtain Sherali-Adams gap examples for any problem that has a Unique Games based hardness result (with some additional conditions on the reduction from Unique Games). Using this, we construct 2-&Epsilon; gap examples for Maximum Acyclic Subgraph that rules out any family of linear constraints with support at most n<sup>&delta;</sup>. Copyright 2009 ACM.

Abstract:We show, by a non-trivial application of the color-coding method of Alon et al.[2], that Budgeted Unique Coverage (a variant of Set Cover) is fixed-parameter tractable, answering an open problem posed in [13]. We also give improved fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for two special cases of Budgeted Unique Coverage: Unique Coverage (the unweighted version) and Budgeted Max Cut. To derandomize our algorithms we use an interesting variation of k-perfect hash families known as (k,s)-hash families which were studied by Alon et al.[1] in the context of a class of codes called parent identifying codes [3]. In this setting, for every s-element subset S of the universe, and every k-element subset X of S, there exists a function that maps X injectively and maps the remaining elements of S into a different range. We give several bounds on the size of (k,s)-hash families. We believe that our application of color-coding may be used for other problems and that this is the first application of (k,s)-hash families to a problem outside the domain of coding theory. &copy; 2009 Springer.

Abstract:We extend a previous model for scheduling commercial advertisements during breaks in television programming. The proposed extension allows differential weighting of conflicts between pairs of commercials. We formulate the problem as a capacitated generalization of the max k-cut problem in which the vertices of a graph correspond to commercial insertions and the edge weights to the conflicts between pairs of insertions. The objective is to partition the vertices into k capacitated sets to maximize the sum of conflict weights across partitions. We note that the problem is NP-hard. We extend a previous local-search procedure to allow for the differential weighting of edge weights. We show that for problems with equal insertion lengths and break durations, the worst-case bound on the performance of the proposed algorithm increases with the number of program breaks and the number of insertions per break, and that it is independent of the number of conflicts between pairs of insertions. Simulation results suggest that the algorithm performs well even if the problem size is small. &copy; 2009 INFORMS.

Abstract:The concept of submodularity plays a vital role in combinatorial optimization. In particular, many important optimization problems can be cast as submodular maximization problems, including maximum coverage, maximum facility location and max cut in directed/undirected graphs. In this paper we present the first known approximation algorithms for the problem of maximizing a non-decreasing submodular set function subject to multiple linear constraints. Given a d-dimensional budget vector L&macr;, for some d &ge; 1, and an oracle for a non-decreasing submodular set function f over a universe U, where each element e &isin; U is associated with a d-dimensional cost vector, we seek a subset of elements S &sube; U whose total cost is at most L&macr;, such that f(S) is maximized. We develop a framework for maximizing submodular functions subject to d linear constraints that yields a (1 - &Epsilon;)(1 -e <sup>-1</sup>)-approximation to the optimum for any &sigmaf; &gt; 0, where d &gt; 1 is some constant. Our study is motivated by a variant of the classical maximum coverage problem that we call maximum coverage with multiple packing constraints. We use our framework to obtain the same approximation ratio for this problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the theoretical bound of 1 - e<sup>-1</sup> is (almost) matched for both of these problems. Copyright &copy; by SIAM.

Abstract:Given a fixed matrix, the problem of column subset selection requests a column submatrix that has favorable spectral properties. Most research from the algorithms and numerical linear algebra communities focuses on a variant called rank-revealing QR, which seeks a well-conditioned collection of columns that spans the (numerical) range of the matrix. The functional analysis literature contains another strand of work on column selection whose algorithmic implications have not been explored. In particular, a celebrated result of Bourgain and Tzafriri demonstrates that each matrix with normalized columns contains a large column submatrix that is exceptionally well conditioned. Unfortunately, standard proofs of this result cannot be regarded as algorithmic. This paper presents a randomized, polynomial-time algorithm that produces the submatrix promised by Bourgain and Tzafriri. The method involves random sampling of columns, followed by a matrix factorization that exposes the well-conditioned subset of columns. This factorization, which is due to Grothendieck, is regarded as a central tool in modern functional analysis. The primary novelty in this work is an algorithm, based on eigenvalue minimization, for constructing the Grothendieck factorization. These ideas also result in an approximation algorithm for the (&infin;, 1) norm of a matrix, which is generally NP-hard to compute exactly. As an added bonus, this work reveals a surprising connection between matrix factorization and the famous MAXCUT semidefinite program. Copyright &copy; by SIAM.

Abstract:Binary factor analysis (BFA) is a typical problem of independent component analysis (ICA) where the signal sources are binary. Parameter learning and model selection in BFA are computationally intractable because of the combinatorial complexity. This paper aims at an efficient approach to BFA. For parameter learning, an unconstrained binary quadratic programming (BQP) is reduced to a canonical dual problem with low computational complexity; for model selection, we adopt the Bayesian Ying-Yang (BYY) framework to make model selection automatically during learning. In the experiments, the proposed approach cdual shows superior performance. Another BQP approximation round is also good in model selection and is more efficient. Two other methods, greedy and enum, are more accurate in BQP but fail to compete with cdual and round in BFA. We conclude that a good optimization is essential in a learning process, but the key task of learning is not simply optimization and an over-accurate optimization may not be preferred.

Abstract:In this paper, a discrete filled function algorithm embedded with continuous approximation is proposed to solve max-cut problems. A new discrete filled function is defined for max-cut problems, and properties of the function are studied. In the process of finding an approximation to the global solution of a max-cut problem, a continuation optimization algorithm is employed to find local solutions of a continuous relaxation of the max-cut problem, and then global searches are performed by minimizing the proposed filled function. Unlike general filled function methods, characteristics of max-cut problems are used. The parameters in the proposed filled function need not to be adjusted and are exactly the same for all max-cut problems that greatly increases the efficiency of the filled function method. Numerical results and comparisons on some well known max-cut test problems show that the proposed algorithm is efficient to get approximate global solutions of max-cut problems.

Abstract:We present an analytic center cutting surface algorithm that uses mixed linear and multiple second-order cone cuts. Theoretical issues and applications of this technique are discussed. From the theoretical viewpoint, we derive two complexity results. We show that an approximate analytic center can be recovered after simultaneously adding p second-order cone cuts in O(plog&isin;(p+1)) Newton steps, and that the overall algorithm is polynomial. From the application viewpoint, we implement our algorithm on mixed linear-quadratic-semidefinite programming problems with bounded feasible region and report some computational results on randomly generated fully dense problems. We compare our CPU time with that of SDPLR, SDPT3, and SeDuMi and show that our algorithm outperforms these software packages on problems with fully dense coefficient matrices. We also show the performance of our algorithm on semidefinite relaxations of the maxcut and Lovasz theta problems. &copy; 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Abstract:This paper establishes the applicability of density functional theory methods to quantum computing systems. We show that ground state and time-dependent density functional theory can be applied to quantum computing systems by proving the Hohenberg-Kohn and Runge-Gross theorems for a fermionic representation of an N qubit system. As a first demonstration of this approach, time-dependent density functional theory is used to determine the minimum energy gap &Delta;(N) arising when the quantum adiabatic evolution algorithm is used to solve instances of the nondeterministic-polynomial-complete problem MAXCUT. It is known that the computational efficiency of this algorithm is largely determined by the large-N scaling behavior of &Delta;(N), and so determining this behavior is of fundamental significance. As density functional theory has been used to study quantum systems with N~10<sup>3</sup> interacting degrees of freedom, the approach introduced in this paper raises the realistic prospect of evaluating the gap &Delta;(N) for systems with N~10<sup>3</sup> qubits. Although the calculation of &Delta;(N) serves to illustrate how density functional theory methods can be applied to problems in quantum computing, the approach has a much broader range and shows promise as a means for determining the properties of very large quantum computing systems.

Abstract:The following problem has been presented in [T. Epping, W. Hochsta&die;ttler, P. Oertel, Complexity results on a paint shop problem, Discrete Applied Mathematics 136 (2004) 217-226] by Epping, Hochsta&die;ttler and Oertel: cars have to be painted in two colors in a sequence where each car occurs twice; assign the two colors to the two occurrences of each car so as to minimize the number of color changes. More generally, the "paint shop scheduling problem" is defined with an arbitrary multiset of colors given for each car, where this multiset has the same size as the number of occurrences of the car; the mentioned article states two conjectures about the general problem and proves its NP-hardness. In a subsequent paper in [P. Bonsma, Th. Epping, W. Hochsta&die;ttler, Complexity results for restricted instances of a paint shop problem for words, Discrete Applied Mathematics 154 (2006) 1335-1343], Bonsma, Epping and Hochsta&die;ttler proved its APX-hardness and noticed the applicability of some classical results in special cases. We first identify the problem concerning two colors as a minimum odd circuit cover problem in particular graphs, exactly situating the problem. A resulting two-way reduction to a special minimum uncut problem leads to polynomial algorithms for subproblems, to observing APX-hardness through MAX CUT in 3-regular graphs, and to a solution with at most 3/4th of all possible remaining color changes (when all obliged color changes have been made). For the general problem concerning an arbitrary number of colors, we realize that the two aforementioned conjectures are corollaries of the celebrated "necklace splitting" theorem of Alon, Goldberg and West. &copy; 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Cross-entropy has been recently proposed as a heuristic method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. We briefly review this methodology and then suggest a hybrid version with the goal of improving its performance. In the context of the well-known max-cut problem, we compare an implementation of the original cross-entropy method with our proposed version. The suggested changes are not particular to the max-cut problem and could be considered for future applications to other combinatorial optimization problems.[All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:A graph is subcubic if its maximum degree is at most 3. The bipartite density of a graph G is defined as b (G) = max {| E (B) | / | E (G) | : B is a bipartite subgraph of G}. It was conjectured by Bondy and Locke that if G is a triangle-free subcubic graph, then b (G) &ge; frac(4, 5) and equality holds only if G is in a list of seven small graphs. The conjecture has been confirmed recently by Xu and Yu. This note gives a shorter proof of this result. &copy; 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract:We present a bound of m/5.769 + O(log n) on the pathwidth of graphs with m edges. Respective path decompositions can be computed in polynomial time. Using a well-known framework for algorithms that rely on tree decompositions, this directly leads to runtime bounds of O*(2<sup>m/5.769</sup>) for Max-2SAT and Max-Cut. Both algorithms require exponential space due to dynamic programming. If we agree to accept a slightly larger bound of m/5.217 +3, we even obtain path decompositions with a rather simple structure: all bags share a large set of common nodes. Using branching based algorithms, this allows us to solve the same problems in polynomial space and time O*(2 <sup>m/5.217</sup>). &copy; 2008 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

Abstract:In this paper, we propose a new continuous approach for the unconstrained binary quadratic programming (BQP) problems based on the Fischer-Burmeister NCP function. Unlike existing relaxation methods, the approach reformulates a BQP problem as an equivalent continuous optimization problem, and then seeks its global minimizer via a global continuation algorithm which is developed by a sequence of unconstrained minimization for a global smoothing function. This smoothing function is shown to be strictly convex in the whole domain or in a subset of its domain if the involved barrier or penalty parameter is set to be sufficiently large, and consequently a global optimal solution can be expected. Numerical results are reported for 0-1 quadratic programming problems from the OR-Library, and the optimal values generated are made comparisons with those given by the well-known SBB and BARON solvers. The comparison results indicate that the continuous approach is extremely promising by the quality of the optimal values generated and the computational work involved, if the initial barrier parameter is chosen appropriately.

Abstract:Given a partition of the vertices of a graph into two sets, a flip is a move of a vertex from its own set to the other, under the condition that it has more incident edges to vertices in its own set than in the other. Every sequence of flips eventually produces a bipartite subgraph capturing more than half of the edges in the graph. Each flip gains at least one edge. For an n-vertex loopless multigraph, we show that there is always a sequence of at most n/2 flips that cannot be extended, and we construct a graph having a sequence of2/25(n<sup>2</sup> + n - 31) flips. &copy;2008 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

Abstract:The network model of fault diagnosis is put forward, so the data clustering is transformed to network segmentation. And the min-max cut criterion is taken as objective function of segmentation. In view of the disadvantage of the higher computation complexity in the traditional min-max cut criterion optimization algorithm, an algorithm using k-means to improve the process of searching optimal segmentation point is introduced. The applications such as benchmark data and four-stage piston compressor diagnosis problem show that the new algorithm has no strict requirements on data distribution, and can achieve feature extraction and diagnosis fast and effectively.

Abstract:We address the problem of optimizing a polynomial with real coefficients over binary variables. We show that a complete polyhedral description of the linearization of such a problem can be derived in a simple way from the polyhedral description of the linearization of some quadratic optimization problem. The number of variables in the latter linearization is only slightly larger than in the former. If polynomial constraints are present in the original problem, then their linearized counterparts carry over to the linearized quadratic problem unchanged. If the original problem formulation does not contain any constraints, we obtain a reduction to unconstrained quadratic zero-one optimization, which is equivalent to the well-studied max-cut problem. The separation problem for general unconstrained polynomial zero-one optimization thus reduces to the separation problem for the cut polytope. This allows us to transfer the entire knowledge gained for the latter polytope by intensive research and, in particular, the sophisticated separation techniques that have been developed. We report preliminary experimental results obtained with a straightforward implementation of this approach.

Abstract:We prove semilogarithmic inapproximability for a maximization problem called unique coverage: given a collection of sets, find a subcollection that maximizes the number of elements covered exactly once. Specifically, assuming that NP &nsube; BPTIME(2n<sup>&epsiv;</sup> ) for an arbitrary &epsiv; &gt; 0, we prove O(1/ log<sup>&sigma;</sup>n) inapproximability for some constant &sigma; = &sigma;(&epsiv;). We also prove O(1 log<sup>1/3-&epsiv;</sup> n) inapproximability for any &epsiv; &gt; 0, assuming that refuting random instances of 3SAT is hard on average; and we prove &Omega;(1/ log n) inapproximability under a plausible hypothesis concerning the hardness of another problem, balanced bipartite independent set. We establish an &Omega;(l/log)-approximation algorithm, even for a more general (budgeted) setting, and obtain an &Omega;(1/log B)-approximation algorithm when every set has at most B elements. We also show that our inapproximability results extend to envy-free pricing, an important problem in computational economics. We describe how the (budgeted) unique coverage problem, motivated by real-world applications, has close connections to other theoretical problems, including max cut, maximum coverage, and radio broadcasting.

Abstract:In many practical applications, the task is to optimize a nonlinear function over a well-studied polytope P as, e.g., the matching polytope or the travelling salesman polytope (TSP). In this paper, we focus on quadratic objective functions. Prominent examples are the quadratic assignment and the quadratic knapsack problem; further applications occur in various areas such as production planning or automatic graph drawing. In order to apply branch-and-cut methods for the exact solution of such problems, they have to be linearized. However, the standard linearization usually leads to very weak relaxations. On the other hand, problem-specific polyhedral studies are often time-consuming. Our goal is the design of general separation routines that can replace detailed polyhedral studies of the resulting polytope and that can be used as a black box. As unconstrained binary quadratic optimization is equivalent to the maximum cut problem, knowledge about cut polytopes can be used in our setting. Other separation routines are inspired by the local cuts that have been developed by Applegate, Bixby, Chvatal and Cook for faster solution of large-scale traveling salesman instances. By extensive experiments, we show that both methods can drastically accelerate the solution of constrained quadratic 0/1 problems.

Abstract:We study the approximability of alternative solutions for NP-problems. In particular, we show that approximating the second best solution is in many cases, such as MAXCUT, MAXSAT, minimum Steiner tree, and others, substantially easier than approximating a first solution. We prove that our polynomial-time approximation scheme for the second best solution of minimum Steiner tree is optimal. In contrast we also argue that for the problems minimum independent dominating set and minimum traveling salesperson problem a given optimal solution does not simplify finding a second best solution.

Abstract:We show a connection between the semidefinite relaxation of unique games and their behavior under parallel repetition. Specifically,denoting by val(G) the value of a two-prover unique game G, andby sdpval(G) the value of a natural semidefinite program to approximate val(G), we prove that for every l &epsi; N, if sdpval(G) &ges; 1-&delta;, then val(G<sup>l</sup>) &ges; 1-&radic;sl&delta;. Here, G<sup>l</sup> denotes the l-fold parallel repetition of G, and s=O(log(k/&delta;)), where k denotes the alphabet size of the game. For the special case where G is an XOR game (i.e., k=2), we obtain the same bound but with s as an absolute constant. Our bounds on s are optimal up to a factor of O(log(1/&delta;)). For games with a significant gap between the quantities val(G) and sdpval(G), our result implies that val(G<sup>l</sup>) may be much larger than val(G)<sup>l</sup>, giving a counterexample to the strong parallel repetition conjecture. In a recent breakthrough, Raz (FOCS'08) has shown such an example using the max-cut game on oddcycles. Our results are based on a generalization of his techniques.

Abstract:We study dense instances of MaxCut and its generalizations. Following a long list of existing, diverse and often sophisticated approximation schemes, we propose taking the naive greedy approach; we prove that when the vertices are considered in random order, our algorithms are still approximation schemes. Our algorithms may be simple, but the analysis is not. It relies on smoothing the vertices defining the partial cuts and on proving certain martingale properties. We also give a simpler proof of the result from Alon, Fernandez de la Vega, Kannan, and Karpinski[1] that dense problems have sample complexity O&tilde;(1/&isin;<sup>4</sup>). Like previous work, our results generalize to dense maximum constraint satisfaction problems.

Abstract:In this paper an island model is described for the unconstrained Binary Quadratic Problem (BQP), which can be used with up to 2500 binary variables. Our island model uses a master-slave structure and the migration is centralized. In the model a basic evolutionary algorithm (EA) runs which is a hybrid, steady-state EA. The basic EA uses a new mutation operator that is composed of two parts and based on a modified version of an explicit collective memory method (EC-memory), the Virtual Loser [2].We tested our island model on the benchmark problems from the OR-Library. Comparing the results with other heuristic methods, we can conclude that our algorithm is highly effective in solving large instances of the BQP; it has a high probability of finding the best-known solutions.

Abstract:Semidefinite Programming(SDP) is one of the strongest algorithmic techniques used in the design of approximation algorithms. In recent years, Unique Games Conjecture(UGC) has proved to be intimately connected to the limitations of Semidefinite Programming. Making this connection precise, we show the following result : If UGC is true, then for every constraint satisfaction problem(CSP) the best approximation ratio is given by a certain simple SDP. Specifically, we show a generic conversion from SDP integrality gaps to UGC hardness results for every CSP. This result holds both for maximization and minimization problems over arbitrary finite domains. Using this connection between integrality gaps and hardness results we obtain a generic polynomial-time algorithm for all CSPs. Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, this algorithm achieves the optimal approximation ratio for every CSP. Unconditionally, for all 2-CSPs the algorithm achieves an approximation ratio equal to the integrality gap of a natural SDP used in literature. Further the algorithm achieves at least as good an approximation ratio as the best known algorithms for several problems like MaxCut, Max2Sat, MaxDiCut and Unique Games. Copyright 2008 ACM.

Abstract:Let G be an undirected graph for which the standard Max- Cut SDP relaxation achieves at least a c fraction of the total edge weight, 1/2&le c &ge; 1. If the actual optimal cut for G is at most an s fraction of the total edge weight, we say that (c, s) is an SDP gap. We define the SDP gap curve Gap<inf>SDP</inf> : [1/2, 1] &rarr [1/2, 1] byGap<inf>SDP</inf>(c) = inf{s : (c, s) is an SDP gap}. In this paper we complete a long line of work [15, 14, 20, 36, 19, 17, 13, 28] by determining the entire SDP gap curve; we show Gap<inf>SDP</inf>(c) = S(c) for a certain explicit (but complicated to state) function S. In particular, our lower bound Gap<inf>SDP</inf>(c) &ge; S(c) is proved via a polynomial-time 'RPR<sup>2</sup>' algorithm. Thus we have given an efficient, optimal SDP-rounding algorithm for Max-Cut. The fact that it is RPR<sup>2</sup> confirms a conjecture of Feige and Langberg [17]. We also describe and analyze the tight connection between SDP gaps and Long Code tests (and the constructions of [25, 3, 4]). Using this connection, we give optimal Long Code tests for Max-Cut. Combining these with results implicit in [27, 29] and ideas from [19], we derive the following conclusions: &bull The Max-Cut SDP gap curve subject to triangle inequalities is also given by S(c). &bull No RPR<sup>2</sup> algorithm can be guaranteed to find cuts of value larger than S(c) in graphs where the optimal cut is c. (Contrast this with the fact that in the graphs exhibiting the c vs. S(c) SDP gap, our RPR<sup>2</sup> algorithm actually finds the optimal cut.) &bull Further, no polynomial-time algorithm of any kind can have such a guarantee, assuming P &ne; NP and the Unique Games Conjecture.

Abstract:Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a population-based swarm intelligence algorithm. A quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is also proposed by combining the classical PSO philosophy and quantum mechanics. These algorithms have been very successful in solving the global continuous optimization, but their applications to combinatorial optimization have been rather limited. Estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) samples new solutions from a probability model which characterizes the distribution of promising solutions. This paper proposes a novel discrete QPSO based on EDA for the combinatorial optimization problem. The proposed algorithm combines global statistical information extracted by EDA with local information obtained by discrete QPSO to create promising solutions. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments are carried out on the unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem which numerous hard combinatorial optimization problems can be formulated as. The results show that the discrete QPSO based on EDA have superior performance to other algorithms. &copy; 2008 IEEE.

Abstract:We show that the NP-hard quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem on a graph G can be solved using an adiabatic quantum computer that implements an Ising spin-1/2 Hamiltonian, by reduction through minor-embedding of G in the quantum hardware graph U. There are two components to this reduction: embedding and parameter setting. The embedding problem is to find a minor-embedding G <inf>emb</inf> of a graph G in U, which is a subgraph of U such that G can be obtained from G <inf>emb</inf> by contracting edges. The parameter setting problem is to determine the corresponding parameters, qubit biases and coupler strengths, of the embedded Ising Hamiltonian. In this paper, we focus on the parameter setting problem. As an example, we demonstrate the embedded Ising Hamiltonian for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem via adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) using an Ising spin-1/2 system. We close by discussing several related algorithmic problems that need to be investigated in order to facilitate the design of adiabatic algorithms and AQC architectures. &copy; 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Abstract:A discrete filled function algorithm is proposed for approximate global solutions of max-cut problems. A new discrete filled function is defined for max-cut problems and the properties of the filled function are studied. Unlike general filled function methods, using the characteristic of max-cut problems, the parameters in proposed filled function need not be adjusted. This greatly increases the efficiency of the filled function method. By combining a procedure that randomly generates initial points for minimization of the filled function, the proposed algorithm can greatly reduce the calculation cost and be applied to large scale max-cut problems. Numerical results on different sizes and densities test problems indicate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and stable to get approximate global solutions of max-cut problems. &copy; 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:Variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristic as presented in Festa et al. [Randomized heuristics for the MAX-CUT problem, Optim. Methods Software 17 (2002) 1033-1058] can obtain high quality solution for max-cut problems. Therefore, it is worthwhile that VNS metaheuristic is extended to solve max-bisection problems. Unfortunately, comparing with max-cut problems, max-bisection problems have more complicated feasible region via the linear constraint e<sup>T</sup> x = 0. It is hard to directly apply the typical VNS metaheuristic to deal with max-bisection problems. In this paper, we skillfully combine the constraint e<sup>T</sup> x = 0 with the objective function, obtain a new optimization problem which is equivalent to the max-bisection problem, and then adopt a distinct greedy local search technique to the resulted problem. A modified VNS metaheuristic based on the greedy local search technique is applied to solve max-bisection problems. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method is efficient and can obtain high equality solution for max-bisection problems. &copy; 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract:The best approximation algorithm for Max Cut in graphs of maximum degree 3 uses semidefinite programming, has approximation ratio 0.9326, and its running time is &Theta; (n<sup>3.5</sup> log n); but the best combinatorial algorithms have approximation ratio 4/5 only, achieved in O (n<sup>2</sup>) time [J.A. Bondy, S.C. Locke, J. Graph Theory 10 (1986) 477-504; E. Halperin, et al., J. Algorithms 53 (2004) 169-185]. Here we present an improved combinatorial approximation, which is a 5/6-approximation algorithm that runs in O (n<sup>2</sup>) time, perhaps improvable even to O (n).

Abstract:Recent work in the analysis of randomized approximation algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems has involved approximating the solution to a problem by the solution of a related subproblem of constant size, where the subproblem is constructed by sampling elements of the original problem uniformly at random. In light of interest in problems with a heterogeneous structure, for which uniform sampling might be expected to yield suboptimal results, we investigate the use of nonuniform sampling probabilities. We develop and analyze an algorithm which uses a novel sampling method to obtain improved bounds for approximating the max-cut of a graph. In particular, we show that by judicious choice of sampling probabilities one can obtain error bounds that are superior to the ones obtained by uniform sampling, both for unweighted and weighted versions of max-cut. Of at least as much interest as the results we derive are the techniques we use. The first technique is a method to compute a compressed approximate decomposition of a matrix as the product of three smaller matrices, each of which has several appealing properties. The second technique is a method to approximate the feasibility or infeasibility of a large linear program by checking the feasibility or infeasibility of a nonuniformly randomly chosen subprogram of the original linear program. We expect that these and related techniques will prove fruitful for the future development of randomized approximation algorithms for problems whose input instances contain heterogeneities.

Abstract:Gutin et&nbsp;al. [G. Gutin, A. Yeo, Polynomial approximation algorithms for the TSP and the QAP with a factorial domination number, Discrete Applied Mathematics 119 (1-2) (2002) 107-116] proved that, in the ATSP problem, a tour of weight not exceeding the weight of an average tour is of dominance ratio at least 1 / (n - 1) for all&nbsp;n &ne; 6. (Tours with this property can be easily obtained.) In [N. Alon, G. Gutin, M. Krivelevich, Algorithms with large domination ratio, Journal on Algorithms 50 (2004) 118-131; G. Gutin, A. Vainshtein, A. Yeo, Domination analysis of combinatorial optimization problems, Discrete Applied Mathematics 129 (2-3) (2003) 513-520; G. Gutin, A. Yeo, Polynomial approximation algorithms for the TSP and the QAP with a factorial domination number, Discrete Applied Mathematics 119 (1-2) (2002) 107-116], algorithms with large dominance ratio were provided for Max Cut, Maxr-Sat, ATSP, and other problems. All these algorithms share a common property - they provide solutions of quality guaranteed to be not worse than the average solution value. In this paper we show that, in general, this property by itself does not necessarily ensure a good performance in terms of dominance. Specifically, we show that for the MaxSat problem, algorithms with this property might perform poorly in terms of dominance. &copy; 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract:In this study, we proposed some alternatives for building a binary hierarchical classification (BHC) systems. Two criteria for building the hierarchical tree under the idea of max-cut are addressed and two additional classification architectures based on the constructed trees are also proposed. The performances of these BHC schemes on Indian Pine Site hyperspectral image will be compared by means of using different base classifiers maximum likelihood (ML),support vector machine (SVM) and 1-nearest-neighbor (INN). The experimental results show that the addressed criteria and classification architectures have satisfactory performances.

Abstract:The "roof dual" of a QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) problem has been introduced in [P.L. Hammer, P.&nbsp;Hansen, B. Simeone, Roof duality, complementation and persistency in quadratic 0-1 optimization, Mathematical Programming 28 (1984) 121-155]; it provides a bound to the optimum value, along with a polynomial test of the sharpness of this bound, and (due to a "persistency" result) it also determines the values of some of the variables at the optimum. In this paper we provide a graph-theoretic approach to provide bounds, which includes as a special case the roof dual bound, and show that these bounds can be computed in O (n<sup>3</sup>) time by using network flow techniques. We also obtain a decomposition theorem for quadratic pseudo-Boolean functions, improving the persistency result of [P.L. Hammer, P. Hansen, B. Simeone, Roof duality, complementation and persistency in quadratic 0-1 optimization, Mathematical Programming 28 (1984) 121-155]. Finally, we show that the proposed bounds (including roof duality) can be applied in an iterated way to obtain significantly better bounds. Computational experiments on problems up to thousands of variables are presented. &copy; 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract:In recent years the unconstrained quadratic binary program has emerged as a unified modeling and solution framework for a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. Experience reported in the literature with several problem classes has demonstrated that this unified approach works surprisingly well in terms of solution quality and computational times, often rivaling and sometimes surpassing special purpose methods. In this paper we report on the application of this unified framework to set packing problems with a variety of coefficient distributions. Computational experience is reported illustrating the attractiveness of the approach. In particular, our results highlight both the effectiveness and robustness of our approach across a wide array of test problems. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:The set-partitioning problem (SPP) is widely known for both its application potential and its computational challenge. This NP-hard problem is known to pose considerable difficulty for classical solution methods such as those based on LP technologies. In recent years, the unconstrained binary quadratic program has proven to perform well as a unified modeling and solution framework for a variety of IP problems. In this paper we illustrate how this unified framework can be applied to SPP. Computational experience is presented, illustrating the attractiveness of the approach.[All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:In this paper, we use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to refine the document clustering results. NMF is a dimensional reduction method and effective for document clustering, because a term-document matrix is high-dimensional and sparse. The initial matrix of the NMF algorithm is regarded as a clustering result, therefore we can use NMF as a refinement method. First we perform min-max cut (Mcut), which is a powerful spectral clustering method, and then refine the result via NMF. Finally we should obtain an accurate clustering result. However, NMF often fails to improve the given clustering result. To overcome this problem, we use the Mcut object function to stop the iteration of NMF. &copy; 2007 by Hiroyuki Shinnou and Minoru Sasaki.

Abstract:This paper considers the unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem encountered in many types of optimization applications. Different linear integer programming formulations were being set up and used in a proposed hybrid heuristic to solve the problem. This hybrid heuristic first obtains an initial solution from solving these linear integer programming formulations, and then improves upon this initial solution with a simple procedure if this initial solution is not the optimal solution to the problem. The computational results of using this hybrid heuristic on certain test problem instances are reported in this paper, together with some comparison and analysis of the solutions obtained.

Abstract:We study linear programming relaxations of vertex cover and max cut arising from repeated applications of the "lift-and-project" method of Lovasz and Schrijver starting from the standard linear programming relaxation. For vertex cover, Arora, Bollobas, Lovasz and Tourlakis prove that the integrality gap remains at least 2 - &epsiv; after &Omega;<sub>&epsiv;</sub> (log n) rounds, where n is the number of vertices, and Tourlakis proves that integrality gap remains at least 1.5 - &epsiv; after &Omega;((log n)<sup>2</sup>) rounds. Fernandez de la Vega and Kenyon prove that the integrality gap of max cut is at most 1/2 + &epsiv; after any constant number of rounds. (Their result also applies to the more powerful Sherali-Adams method.) We prove that the integrality gap of vertex cover remains at least 2 - &epsiv; after &Omega;<sub>&epsiv;</sub>(n) rounds, and that the integrality gap of max cut remains at most 1/2 + &epsiv; after &Omega;<sub>&epsiv;</sub>(n) rounds.

Abstract:Exact Max-SAT solvers, compared with SAT solvers, apply little inference at each node of the proof tree. Commonly used SAT inference rules like unit propagation produce a simplified formula that preserves satisfiability but, unfortunately, solving the Max-SAT problem for the simplified formula is not equivalent to solving it for the original formula. In this paper, we define a number of original inference rules that, besides being applied efficiently, transform Max-SAT instances into equivalent Max-SAT instances which are easier to solve. The soundness of the rules, that can be seen as refinements of unit resolution adapted to Max-SAT, are proved in a novel and simple way via an integer programming transformation. With the aim of finding out how powerful the inference rules are in practice, we have developed a new Max-SAT solver, called MaxSatz, which incorporates those rules, and performed an experimental investigation. The results provide empirical evidence that MaxSatz is very competitive, at least, on random Max-2SAT, random Max-3SAT, Max-Cut, and Graph 3-coloring instances, as well as on the benchmarks from the Max-SAT Evaluation 2006.

Abstract:Given a graph with non-negative edge weights, the MAX-CUT problem is to partition the set of vertices into two subsets so that the sum of the weights of edges with endpoints in different subsets is maximised. This classical NP-hard problem finds applications in VLSI design, statistical physics, and classification among other fields. This paper compares the performance of several greedy construction heuristics for MAX-CUT problem. In particular, a new 'worst-out' approach is studied and the proposed edge contraction heuristic is shown to have an approximation ratio of at least 1/3. The results of experimental comparison of the worst-out approach, the well-known best-in algorithm, and modifications for both are also included.

Abstract:The Cross-Entropy (CE) method is a modern and effective optimization method well suited to parallel implementations. There is a vast array of problems today, some of which are highly complex and can take weeks or even longer to solve using current optimization techniques. This paper presents a general method for designing parallel CE algorithms for Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD) distributed memory machines using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library routines. We provide examples of its performance for two well-known test-cases: the (discrete) Max-Cut problem and (continuous) Rosenbrock problem. Speedup factors and a comparison to sequential CE methods are reported. &copy; 2007 IEEE.

Abstract:We give improved parameterized algorithms for two &ldquo;edge&rdquo; problems MAXCUT and MAXDAG, where the solution sought is a subset of edges. MAXCUT of a graph is a maximum set of edges forming a bipartite subgraph of the given graph. On the other hand, MAXDAG of a directed graph is a set of arcs of maximum size such that the graph induced on these arcs is acyclic. Our algorithms are obtained through new kernelization and efficient exact algorithms for the optimization versions of the problems. More precisely our results include: (i) a kernel with at most &alpha;k vertices and &beta;k edges for MAXCUT. Here 0&lt;&alpha;&les;1 and 1&lt;&beta;&les;2. Values of &alpha; and &beta; depends on the number of vertices and the edges in the graph; (ii) a kernel with at most 4k/3 vertices and 2k edges for MAXDAG; (iii) an O*(1.2418<sup>k</sup>) parameterized algorithm for MAXCUT in undirected graphs. This improves the O*(1.4143<sup>k</sup>)<sup>1</sup> algorithm presented in [E. Prieto, The method of extremal structure on the k-maximum cut problem, in: The Proceedings of Computing: The Australasian Theory Symposium (CATS), 2005, pp. 119-126]; (iv) an O*(2<sup>n</sup>) algorithm for optimization version of MAXDAG in directed graphs. This is the first such algorithm to the best of our knowledge; (v) an O*(2<sup>k</sup>) parameterized algorithm for MAXDAG in directed graphs. This improves the previous best of O*(4<sup>k</sup>) presented in [V. Raman, S. Saurabh, Parameterized algorithms for feedback set problems and their duals in tournaments, Theoretical Computer Science 351 (3) (2006) 446-458]; (vi) an O*(16<sup>k</sup>) parameterized algorithm to determine whether an oriented graph having m arcs has an acyclic subgraph with at least m/2+k arcs. This improves the O*(2<sup>k</sup>) algorithm given in [V. Raman, S. Saurabh, Parameterized algorithms for feedback set problems and their duals in tournaments, Theoretical Computer Science 351 (3) (2006) 446-458]. In addition, we show that if a directed graph has minimum out degree at least f(n) (some function of n) then Directed Feedback Arc Set problem is fixed parameter tractable. The parameterized complexity of Directed Feedback Arc Set is a well-known open problem.[All rights reserved Elsevier].

Abstract:Linear and semidefinite programming are highly successful approaches for obtaining good approximations for NP-hard optimization problems. For example, breakthrough approximation algorithms for MAX CUT and SPARSEST CUT use semidefinite programming. Perhaps the most prominent NP-hard problem whose exact approximation factor is still unresolved is VERTEX COVER. PCP-based techniques of Dinur and Safra [7] show that it is not possible to achieve a factor better than 1.36; on the other hand no known algorithm does better than the factor of 2 achieved by the simple greedy algorithm. Furthermore, there is a widespread belief that SDP techniques are the most promising methods available for improving upon this factor of 2. Following a line of study initiated by Arora et al. [3], our aim is to show that a large family of LP and SDP based algorithms fail to produce, an approximation for VERTEX COVER better than 2. Lova&acute;sz and Schrijver [21] introduced the systems LS and LS<inf>+</inf> for systematically tightening LP and SDP relaxations, respectively, over many rounds. These systems naturally capture large classes of LP and SDP relaxations; indeed, LS<inf>+</inf> captures the celebrated SDP-based algorithms for MAX CUT and SPARSEST CUT mentioned above. We. rule out polynomial-time 2 - &Omega;(1) approximations for VERTEX COVER using LS<inf>+</inf>. In particular, we prove an integrality gap of 2 - o(1) for VERTEX COVER SDPs obtained by tightening the standard LP relaxation with &Omega;(&radic;log n/log log n) rounds of LS <inf>+</inf>. While tight integrality gaps were known for VERTEX COVER in the weaker LS system [23], previous results did not rule out a 2 - &Omega;(1) approximation after even two rounds of LS<inf>+</inf>. &copy; 2007 IEEE.

Abstract:This paper considers the problem of estimation over communication networks. Suppose a sensor is taking measurements of a dynamic process. However the process needs to be estimated at a remote location connected to the sensor through a network of communication links that drop packets stochastically. We provide a framework for computing the optimal performance in the sense of expected error covariance. Using this framework we characterize the dependency of the performance on the topology of the network and the packet dropping process. For independent and memoryless packet dropping processes we find the steady-state error for some classes of networks and obtain lower and upper bounds for the performance of a general network. Finally we find a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the estimate error covariance for general networks with spatially correlated and Markov type dropping process. This interesting condition has a max-cut interpretation. &copy; 2007 IEEE.

Abstract:In this paper we show a reduction from the Unique Games problem to the problem of approximating MAX-CUT to within a factor of &alpha;Gw +&Epsilon; for all &Epsilon; &gt; 0; here &alpha;Gw &asyum; .878567 denotes the approximation ratio achieved by the algorithm of Goemans and Williamson in [J. Assoc. Comput. Mach., 42 (1995), pp. 1115-1145]. This implies that if the Unique Games Conjecture of Khot in [Proceedings of the 34th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2002, pp. 767-775] holds, then the Goemans-Williamson approximation algorithm is optimal. Our result indicates that the geometric nature of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm might be intrinsic to the MAX-CUT problem. Our reduction relies on a theorem we call Majority Is Stablest. This was introduced as a conjecture in the original version of this paper, and was subsequently confirmed in [E. Mossel, R. O'Donnell, and K. Oleszkiewicz, Proceedings of the 46th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2005, pp. 21-30]. A stronger version of this conjecture called Plurality Is Stablest is still open, although [E. Mossel, R. O'Donnell, and K. Oleszkiewicz, Proceedings of the 46th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2005, pp. 21-30] contains a proof of an asymptotic version of it. Our techniques extend to several other two-variable constraint satisfaction problems. In particular, subject to the Unique Games Conjecture, we show tight or nearly tight hardness results for MAX-2SAT, MAX-q-CUT, and MAX-2LIN(q). For MAX-2SAT we show approximation hardness up to a factor of roughly .943. This nearly matches the .940 approximation algorithm of Lewin, Livnat, and Zwick in [Proceedings of the 9th Annual Conference on Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2002, pp. 67-82]. Furthermore, we show that our .943... factor is actually tight for a slightly restricted version of MAX-2SAT. For MAX-q-CUT we show a hardness factor which asymptotically (for large q) matches the approximation factor achieved by Frieze and Jerrum [Improved approximation algorithms for MAX k-CUT and MAX BISECTION, in Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, pp. 1-13], namely 1 - 1/q + 2(In q)/q<sup>2</sup>. For MAX-2LIN(q) we show hardness of distinguishing between instances which are (1 - &Epsilon;)-satisfiable and those which are not even, roughly, (q<sup>-&Epsilon;/2</sup>)-satisfiable. These parameters almost match those achieved by the recent algorithm of Charikar, Makarychev, and Makarychev [Proceedings of the 38th .Annital ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2006, pp. 205-214]. The hardness result holds even for instances in which all equations are of the form X<inf>i</inf> -X<inf>j</inf> = c. At a more qualitative level, this result also implies that 1 - &Epsilon; vs. &Epsilon; hardness for MAX-2LIN(q) is equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture. &copy; 2007 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

Abstract:Prior algorithms known for exactly solving MAX 2-SAT improve upon the trivial upper bound only for very sparse instances. We present new algorithms for exactly solving (in fact, counting) weighted MAX 2-SAT instances. One of them has a good performance if the underlying constraint graph has a small separator decomposition, another has a slightly improved worst case performance. For a 2-SAT instance F with n variables, the worst case running time is O&tilde;(2<sup>1-1/(d&tilde;(F)_1))n</sup>), where d&tilde;(F) is the average degree in the constraint graph defined by F. We use strict &alpha;-gadgets introduced by Trevisan, Sorkin, Sudan, and Williamson to get the same upper bounds for problems like MAX 3-SAT and MAX CUT. We also introduce a notion of strict (&alpha;, &beta;)-gadget to provide a framework that allows composition of gadgets. This framework allows us to obtain the same upper bounds for MAX k-SAT and MAX k-LIN-2. &copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Abstract:We consider the parameterized complexity of the UNIQUE COVERAGE problem: given a family of sets and a parameter k, we ask whether there exists a subfamily that covers at least k elements exactly once. This NP-complete problem has applications in wireless networks and radio broadcasting and is also a natural generalization of the wellknown MAX CUT problem. We show that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter k. That is, for every fixed k, there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for it. One way to prove a problem fixed-parameter tractable is to show that it is kernelizable. To this end, we show that if no two sets in the input family intersect in more than c elements there exists a problem kernel of size k<sup>c+1</sup>. This yields a k<sup>k</sup> kernel for the UNIQUE COVERAGE problem, proving fixed-parameter trectability. Subsequently, we show a 4<sup>k</sup> kernel for this problem. However a more general weighted version, with costs associated with each set and profits with each element, turns out to be much harder. The question here is whether there exists a subfamily with total cost at most a prespecified budget B such that the total profit of uniquely covered elements is at least k, where B and k are part of the input. In the most general setting, assuming real costs and profits, the problem is not fixed-parameter tractable unless P = NP. Assuming integer costs and profits we show the problem to be W[1]-hard with respect to B as parameter (that is, it is unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable). However, under some reasonable restriction, the problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable with respect to both B and k as parameters. &copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Abstract:In this paper we present a method for finding exact solutions of the Max-Cut problem max x<sup>T</sup> Lx such that x &isin; {-1, 1}<sup>n</sup>. We use a semidefinite relaxation combined with triangle inequalities, which we solve with the bundle method. This approach is due to Fischer, Gruber, Rendl, and Sotirov [12] and uses Lagrangian duality to get upper bounds with reasonable computational effort. The expensive part of our bounding procedure is solving the basic semidefinite programming relaxation of the Max-Cut problem. We review other solution approaches and compare the numerical results with our method. We also extend our experiments to unconstrained quadratic 0-1 problems and to instances of the graph bisection problem. The experiments show, that our method nearly always outperforms all other approaches. Our algorithm, which is publicly accessible through the Internet, can solve virtually any instance with about 100 variables in a routine way. &copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Abstract:We introduce a genetic model based on simulated crossover of fixed sequences of two bit genes. States and dynamics of the deterministic genetic system, represented by the model , are derived in the case of infinite populations and for finite fitness functions (expressed in terms of multivariate polynomials). The genetic algorithm (simulating the proposed infinite population system) is experimentally compared with the infinite population genetic algorithm with bit-based simulated crossover for the MAC-CUT problem.

Abstract:Many lower bound computation methods for branch and bound Max-SAT solvers can be explained as procedures that search for disjoint inconsistent subformulas in the Max-SAT instance under consideration. The difference among them is the technique used to detect inconsistencies. In this paper, we define five new lower bound computation methods: two of them are based on detecting inconsistencies via a unit propagation procedure that propagates unit clauses using an original ordering; the other three add an additional level of forward look-ahead based on detecting failed literals. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the new lower bounds are of better quality than the existing lower bounds, as well as that a solver with our new lower bounds greatly outperforms some of the best performing state-of-the-art Max-SAT solvers on Max-2SAT, Max-3SAT, and Max-Cut instances.

Abstract:The maximum constraint satisfaction problem (Max CSP) is the following computational problem: an instance is a finite collection of constraints on a set of variables, and the goal is to assign values to the variables that maximises the number of satisfied constraints. Max CSP captures many well-known problems (such as Max k-SAT and max cut) and so is NP-hard in general. It is natural to study how restrictions on the allowed constraint types (or constraint language) affect the complexity and approximability of Max CSP. All constraint languages, for which the CSP problem (i.e., the problem of deciding whether all constraints in an instance can be simultaneously satisfied) is currently known to be NP-hard, have a certain algebraic property, and it has been conjectured that CSP problems are tractable for all other constraint languages. We prove that any constraint language with this algebraic property makes Max CSP hard at gap location 1, thus ruling out the existence of a polynomial-time approximation scheme for such problems. We then apply this result to Max CSP restricted to a single constraint type. We show that, unless P = NP, such problems either are trivial or else do not admit polynomial-time approximation schemes. All our hardness results hold even if the number of occurrences of each variable is bounded by a constant.

Abstract:In this paper we present a method for finding exact solutions of the max-cut problem Max x<sup>T</sup> Lx such that x&isin; {-1, 1}<sup>n</sup>. We use a semidefinite relaxation combined with triangle inequalities, which we solve with the bundle method. This approach is due to Fischer, Gruber, Rendl, and Sotirov and uses Lagrangian duality to get upper bounds with reasonable computational effort. The expensive part of our bounding procedure is solving the basic semidefinite programming relaxation of the max-cut problem. We review other solution approaches and compare the numerical results with our method. We also extend our experiments to unconstrained quadratic 0-1 problems and to instances of the graph bisection problem. The experiments show, that our method nearly always outperforms all other approaches. Our algorithm, which is publicly accessible through the Internet, can solve virtually any instance with about 100 variables in a routine way.

Abstract:Optimized solvers for the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem have many applications in areas such as hardware and software verification, FPGA routing, planning, and so forth. Further uses are complicated by the need to express "counting constraints" in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Expressing such constraints by pure CNF leads to more complex SAT instances. Alternatively, those constraints can be handled by integer linear programming (ILP), but generic ILP solvers may ignore the Boolean nature of 0-1 variables. Therefore, specialized 0-1 ILP solvers extend SAT solvers to handle these so-called "pseudo-Boolean" (PB) constraints. This work provides an update on the on-going competition between generic ILP techniques and specialized 0-1 ILP techniques. To make a fair comparison, we generalize recent ideas for fast SAT-solving to more general 0-1 ILP problems that may include counting constraints and optimization. This generalization is embodied in our PB constraint solver and optimizer PBS, which is compared with state-of-the-art CNF and generic ILP solvers. Another aspect of our comparison is the evaluation on 0-1 ILP benchmarks that originate in electronic design automation (EDA) but that cannot be directly solved by an SAT solver. Specifically, we solve instances of the max-SAT and max-ONEs optimization problems, which seek to maximize the number of satisfied clauses and the "true" values over all satisfying assignments, respectively. Those problems have straightforward applications to SAT-based routing and are additionally important due to reductions from max-cut, max-clique, and min vertex cover. Our experimental results show that specialized 0-1 techniques implemented in PBS tend to outperform generic ILP techniques on Boolean optimization problems, as well as on general EDA SAT problems.

Abstract:In this work a new algorithm to improve the performance of optimization methods, by means of avoiding certain local optima, is described. Its theoretical bases are presented in a rigorous, but intuitive, way. It has been applied concretely to the case of recurrent neural networks, in particular to MREM, a multivalued recurrent model, that has proved to obtain very good results when dealing with NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems. In order to show its efficiency, the well-known MaxCut problem for graphs has been selected as benchmark. Our proposal outperforms other specialized and powerful techniques, as shown by simulations.

Abstract:We propose a new local search heuristic for graph coloring that searches very large neighborhoods. The heuristic is based on solving a max-cut problem at each step, while the max-cut problem is formally hard, fast heuristics that give "good" cuts are available to solve this. We provide computational results on benchmark instances. The proposed approach is based on similar heuristics used in computer vision.

Abstract:This paper introduces a new model for the planar maximal covering location problem (PMCLP) under different block norms. The problem involves locating g facilities anywhere on the plane in order to cover the maximum number of n given demand points. The generalization, in this paper, is that the distance measures assigned to facilities are block norms of different types and different proximity measures. First, the PMCLP under different block norms is modelled as a maximum clique partition problem on an equivalent multi-interval graph. Then, the equivalent graph problem is modelled as an unconstrained binary quadratic problem (UQP). Both the maximum clique partition problem and the UQP are NP-hard problems; therefore, we solve the UQP format through a genetic algorithm heuristic. Computational examples are given.

Abstract:The unconstrained quadratic binary program (UQP) is proving to be a successful modeling and solution framework for a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. Experience reported in the literature with several problem classes has demonstrated that this approach works surprisingly well in terms of solution quality and computational times, often rivaling and sometimes surpassing more traditional methods. In this paper we report on the application of UQP to the maximum edge-weighted clique problem. Computational experience is reported illustrating the attractiveness of the approach.

Abstract:We analyze a bivariate marginal distribution genetic model in case of infinite populations and provide relations between the associated infinite population genetic system and the neural networks. A lower bound on population size is exhibited stating that the behaviour of the finite population system, in case of sufficiently large sizes, can be suitably approximated by the behaviour of the corresponding infinite population system for a number of transitions exponentially greater than that suggested by Vose's analysis. The infinite population system is analyzed by showing that, conversely to what happens in the univariate case, the fitness is not a Lyapunov function for its asynchronous variant. The attractors (with binary components) of the infinite population genetic system are characterized as equilibrium points of a discrete (neural network) system that can be considered as a variant of a Hopfield's network; it is shown that the fitness is a Lyapunov function for the variant of the discrete Hopfield's net. The genetic algorithm based on the proposed infinite population system is experimentally compared with the (neural) network algorithm for the max-cut problem. Our main result can be summarized by stating that the relation between marginal distribution genetic systems and neural nets is much more general than that already shown elsewhere for the univariate models.

Abstract:We present a family of local-search-based heuristics for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), all of which start with a (possibly fractional) initial point, sequentially improving its quality by rounding or switching the value of one variable, until arriving to a local optimum. The effects of various parameters on the efficiency of these methods are analyzed through computational experiments carried out on thousands of randomly generated problems having 20 to 2500 variables. Tested on numerous benchmark problems, the performance of the most competitive variant (ACSIOM) was shown to compare favorably with that of other published procedures

Abstract:In this paper, we first demonstrate that positive semidefiniteness of a large well-structured sparse symmetric matrix can be represented via positive semidefiniteness of a bunch of smaller matrices linked, in a linear fashion, to the matrix. We derive also the "dual counterpart" of the outlined representation, which expresses the possibility of positive semidefinite completion of a well-structured partially defined symmetric matrix in terms of positive semidefiniteness of a specific bunch of fully defined submatrices of the matrix. Using the representations, we then reformulate well-structured large-scale semidefinite problems into smooth convex-concave saddle point problems, which can be solved by a Prox-method developed in [6] with efficiency script O sign (&Epsilon;<sup>-1</sup>). Implementations and some numerical results for large-scale Lova&acute;sz capacity and MAXCUT problems are finally presented. &copy; Springer-Verlag 2007.

Abstract:The class Max (r, 2)-CSP, or simply Max 2-CSP, consists of constraint satisfaction problems with at most two r-valued variables per clause. For instances with n variables and m binary clauses, we present an O (n r<sup>5 + 19 m / 100</sup>)-time algorithm which is the fastest polynomial-space algorithm for many problems in the class, including Max Cut. The method also proves a treewidth bound tw (G) &le (13 / 75 + o (1)) m, which gives a faster Max 2-CSP&nbsp;algorithm that uses exponential space: running in time O<sup>{star operator}</sup> (2<sup>(13 / 75 + o (1)) m</sup>), this is fastest for most problems in Max 2-CSP. Parametrizing in terms of n rather than m, for graphs of average degree d we show a simple algorithm running time O<sup>{star operator}</sup> (2<sup>(1 - frac(2, d + 1)) n</sup>), the fastest polynomial-space algorithm known. In combination with "Polynomial&nbsp;CSPs" introduced in a companion paper, these algorithms also allow (with an additional polynomial factor overhead in space and time) counting and sampling, and the solution of problems like Max Bisection that escape the usual CSP framework. Linear programming is key to the design as well as the analysis of the algorithms. &copy; 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract:The aim of this paper is to present the stochastic version of the multivalued neural model MREM, which has achieved very good results in many applications, as an optimization technique. The purpose of this stochastic version is to avoid certain local minima of the objective function minimized by the network, that is, the energy function. To this end, the description of the theoretical bases of this model, guaranteeing the convergence to minima, is carried out rigorously. In order to show the efficiency of this new model, the model, in its two versions, deterministic and stochastic, has been applied to the resolution of the well-known problem of graph partition, MaxCut. Computational experiments show that in most cases the stochastic model achieves better results than the deterministic one.

Abstract:In this paper, we consider problem (P) of minimizing a quadratic function q(x)=x <sup>t</sup> Qx+c <sup>t</sup> x of binary variables. Our main idea is to use the recent Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) solvers. But, for this, we have to first convexify the objective function q(x). A classical trick is to raise up the diagonal entries of Q by a vector u until (Q+diag(u)) is positive semidefinite. Then, using the fact that x <inf>i</inf> <sup>2</sup>=x <inf>i</inf>, we can obtain an equivalent convex objective function, which can then be handled by an MIQP solver. Hence, computing a suitable vector u constitutes a preprocessing phase in this exact solution method. We devise two different preprocessing methods. The first one is straightforward and consists in computing the smallest eigenvalue of Q. In the second method, vector u is obtained once a classical SDP relaxation of (P) is solved. We carry out computational tests using the generator of (Pardalos and Rodgers, 1990) and we compare our two solution methods to several other exact solution methods. Furthermore, we report computational results for the max-cut problem. &copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Abstract:In this study, the performances of hyperspectral image classification using three max-cut based BHC schemes are compared. The first one is original BHC scheme and the second is applied feature extraction in the root node. The last is applied feature extraction in the each non-leaf node. The real data experimental results show that applying feature extraction in the each non-leaf node is the best strategy. Among the combinations of two feature extraction methods, DAFE and NWFE and three base classifiers, using NWFE and ML base classifier can reach the best performance.

Abstract:In this paper, we introduce a programmable particle swarm evolving on a sphere called swarm on sphere system. This model is a polynomial dynamical system obtained from a consensus algorithm that exhibits a rich set of synchronous behaviors with close connections to the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators, coalition formation in social networks, small-words, integer programming problems such as max-cut, and networks of self-synchronous oscillators with applications to synthetic biology. We prove the generalized Kuramoto model can be obtained as a special case of this model in dimension two. Moreover, we provide formal stability analysis of aligned, bipolar, and dispersed synchronous modes of the system. As a byproduct of this stability analysis, we obtain simple algorithms for programming the weights of the swarm enabling it to exhibit various desired patterns of synchrony. Simulation results are provided that demonstrate 3-D in-phase synchrony, coalition formation for interacting agents with mixed-sign couplings, and dispersal behavior with spatial order. &copy; 2006 IEEE.

Abstract:Given a graph with maximum cut of (fractional) size c, the Goemans-Williamson [GW95] semidefinite programming (SDP) algorithm is guaranteed to find a cut of size .878 &amp;&middot c. However this guarantee becomes trivial when c is near 1/2, since a random cut has expected size 1/2. Recently, Charikar and Worth [CW04] (analyzing an algorithm of Feige and Langberg [FL01]) showed that given a graph with maximum cut 1/2 + &Epsilon;, one can find a cut of size 1/2 + &omega; (&Epsilon; / log(1/&Epsilon;)). The main contribution of our paper is twofold: 1. We give a natural 1/2 + &Epsilon; vs. 1/2 + O(&Epsilon;/ log(1/&Epsilon;)) SDP gap for MAXCUT in Gaussian space. This shows that the SDP-rounding algorithm of Charikar-Worth is essentially best possible. Further, the "s-linear rounding functions" used in [CW04, FL01] arise as optimizers in our analysis, somewhat confirming a suggestion of [FL01]. 2. We show how this SDP gap can be translated into a Long Code test with the same parameters. This implies that beating the Charikar-Worth guarantee with any efficient algorithm is NP-hard, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) [Kho02]. We view this result as essentially settling the approximability of MAXCUT, assuming UGC. Building on (1) we show how "randomness reduction" on related SDP gaps for the QUADRATICPRO-GRAMMlNG programming problem lets us make the &Omega;(log(1/&Epsilon;)) gap as large as &Omega;(log n) for n-vertex graphs. In addition to optimally answering an open question of [AMMN06], this technique may prove useful for other SDP gap problems. Finally, illustrating the generality of our technique in (2), we also show how to translate Reeds's [Ree93] SDP gap for the Grothendieck Inequality into a UGC-hardness result for computing the &par;&middot&par; <inf>&infin;&rarr1</inf> norm of a matrix. &copy; 2006 IEEE.

Abstract:Supertree methods are used to construct a large tree over a large set of taxa from a set of small trees over overlapping subsets of the complete taxa set. Since accurate reconstruction methods are currently limited to a maximum of a few dozen taxa, the use of a supertree method in order to construct the tree of life is inevitable. Supertree methods are broadly divided according to the input trees: When the input trees are unrooted, the basic reconstruction unit is a quartet tree. In this case, the basic decision problem of whether there exists a tree that agrees with all quartets is NP-complete. On the other hand, when the input trees are rooted, the basic reconstruction unit is a rooted triplet and the above decision problem has a polynomial time algorithm. However, when there is no tree which agrees with all triplets, it would be desirable to find the tree that agrees with the maximum number of triplets. However, this optimization problem was shown to be NP-hard. Current heuristic approaches perform min cut on a graph representing the triplets inconsistency and return a tree that is guaranteed to satisfy some required properties. In this work, we present a different heuristic approach that guarantees the properties provided by the current methods and give experimental evidence that it significantly outperforms currently used methods. This method is based on a divide and conquer approach, where the min cut in the divide step is replaced by a max cut in a variant of the same graph. The latter is achieved by a lightweight semidefinite programming-like heuristic that leads to very fast running times

Abstract:We introduce a genetic model based on simulated crossover of fixed sequences of two-bit genes. Results are (1) a lower bound on population size is exhibited such that a transition takes the stochastic finite population genetic system near the next state of the deterministic infinite population genetic system (provided both begin in the same state); (2) states and dynamics of the deterministic infinite population genetic system are derived for arbitrary (finite) fitness functions (expressed in terms of multivariate polynomials); (3) in the case of quadratic fitness defined by weight matrices with m nonnull entries it is shown that each state transition can be implemented in time O(m+l), where l is the chromosome length; (4) the genetic algorithm (implementing the proposed infinite population system) is experimentally compared with the infinite population genetic algorithm with bit-based simulated crossover for the max-cut problem; the results show that the extension to sequences of genes with four alleles is useful to improve performances.

Abstract:An effective continuous algorithm is proposed to find approximate solutions of NP-hard max-cut problems. The algorithm relaxes the max-cut problem into a continuous nonlinear programming problem by replacing n discrete constraints in the original problem with one single continuous constraint. A feasible direction method is designed to solve the resulting nonlinear programming problem. The method employs only the gradient evaluations of the objective function, and no any matrix calculations and no line searches are required. This greatly reduces the calculation cost of the method, and is suitable for the solution of large size max-cut problems. The convergence properties of the proposed method to KKT points of the nonlinear programming are analyzed. If the solution obtained by the proposed method is a global solution of the nonlinear programming problem, the solution will provide an upper bound on the max-cut value. Then an approximate solution to the max-cut problem is generated from the solution of the nonlinear programming and provides a lower bound on the max-cut value. Numerical experiments and comparisons on some max-cut test problems (small and large size) show that the proposed algorithm is efficient to get the exact solutions for all small test problems and well satisfied solutions for most of the large size test problems with less calculation costs.

Abstract:The ground-state susceptibility of a system consisting of three flux-qubits was measured in the complete three-dimensional flux space around the common degeneracy point of the qubits. The system's Hamiltonian could be completely reconstructed from measurements made far away from the common degeneracy point. The subsequent measurements made around this point show complete agreement with the theoretical predictions which follow from this Hamiltonian. The ground-state anti-crossings of the system could be read out directly from these measurements. This allows one to determine the ground-state flux diagram, which provides the solution for the non-polynomial optimization problem MAXCUT encoded in the Hamiltonian of the three-flux-qubit system. Our results show that adiabatic quantum computation can be demonstrated with this system provided that the minimal energy gap and/or the speed of the read-out is increased

Abstract:We introduce the maximum graph homomorphism (MGH) problem: given a graph G, and a target graph H, find a mapping &phi;: V<sub>G</sub> &harr; V<sub>H</sub> that maximizes the number of edges of G that are mapped to edges of H. This problem encodes various fundamental NP-hardproblems including Maxcut and Max-k-cut. We also consider the multiway uncut problem. We are given a graph G and a set of terminals T &sube; V<sub>G</sub>. We want to partition V<sub>G</sub> into |T| parts, each containing exactly one terminal, so as to maximize the number of edges in E<sub>G</sub> having both endpoints in the same part. Multiway uncut can be viewed as a special case of prelabeled MGH where one is also given a prelabeling &phi;': U &harr; V<sub>H</sub>, U &sube; V<sub>G</sub>, and the output has to be an extension of &phi;'. Both MGH and multiway uncut have a trivial 0.5-approximation algorithm. We present a 0.8535-approximation algorithm for multiway uncut based on a natural linear programming relaxation. This relaxation has an integrality gap of 6/7 &sime; 0.8571, showing that our guarantee is almost tight. For maximum graph homomorphism, we show that a (1/2 + &epsi;<sub>0</sub>) approximation algorithm, for any constant &epsi;<sub>0</sub> &gt; 0, implies an algorithm for distinguishing between certain average-case instances of the subgraph isomorphism problem that appear to be hard. Complementing this, we give a (1/2 + &Omega;(1/|H|log|H|))-approximation algorithm

Abstract:An effective continuous algorithm is proposed to find approximate solutions of NP-hard max-cut problems. The algorithm relaxes the max-cut problem into a continuous nonlinear programming problem by replacing n discrete constraints in the original problem with one single continuous constraint. A feasible direction method is designed to solve the resulting nonlinear programming problem. The method employs only the gradient evaluations of the objective function, and no any matrix calculations and no line searches are required. This greatly reduces the calculation cost of the method, and is suitable for the solution of large size max-cut problems. The convergence properties of the proposed method to KKT points of the nonlinear programming are analyzed. If the solution obtained by the proposed method is a global solution of the nonlinear programming problem, the solution provides an upper bound on the max-cut value. Then an approximate solution to the max-cut problem is generated from the solution of the nonlinear programming and provides a lower bound on the max-cut value. Numerical experiments and comparisons on some max-cut test problems (small and large size) show that the proposed algorithm is efficient to get the exact solutions for all small test problems and well satisfied solutions for most of the large size test problems with less calculation costs

Abstract:Conventional &Epsilon;-Support Vector Regression (&Epsilon;-SVR) is formulated as a constrained minimization problem, i. e., a convex quadratic programming problem. Lee et al. used the smoothing techniques to replace the square of &Epsilon;-insensitive loss function and named the reformulation Smooth &Epsilon;-Support Vector Regressiop (&Epsilon;-SSVR). Thus &Epsilon;-SVR can be solved as a smooth unconstrained minimization problem by the Newton-Armijo algorithm directly. Using two new polynomials as smoothing functions for solving &Epsilon;-SVR, this paper proposes Polynomial Smooth &Epsilon;-Support Vector Regression (&Epsilon;-PSSVR). It is proved that &Epsilon;-PSSVR is globally convergent with a smaller upper bound than that of &Epsilon;-SSVR. The nice features of &Epsilon;-PSSVR lend itself to the BFGS-Armijo algorithm or Newton-Armijo algorithm. Numerical results show that &Epsilon;-PSSVR is better than &Epsilon;-SSVR in terms of regression accuracy and computational cost.

Abstract:Lovdsz and Schrijver [13] defined three progressively stronger procedures LS<inf>0</inf>, LS and LS<inf>+</inf>, for systematically tightening linear relaxations over many rounds. All three procedures yield the integral hull after at most n rounds. On the other hand, constant rounds of LS<inf>+</inf> can derive the relaxations behind many famous approximation algorithms such as those for MAX-CUT, SPARSEST-CUT. So proving round lower bounds for these procedures on specific problems may give evidence about inapproximability. We prove new round lower bounds for VERTEX COVER in the LS hierarchy. Arora et al. [3] showed that the integrality gap for VERTEX COVER relaxations remains 2-o(1) even after &omega;(log n) rounds LS. However, their method can only prove round lower bounds as large as the girth of the input graph, which is O(logn)for interesting graphs. We break through this "girth barrier" and show that the integrality gap for VERTEX COVER remains 1.5 - &Epsilon; even after &omega;(log<sup>2</sup> n) rounds of LS. In contrast, the best PCP-based results only rule out 1.36-approximations. Moreover, we conjecture that the new technique we introduce to prove our lower bound, the "fence" method, may lead to linear or nearly linear LS round lower bounds for VERTEX COVER. &copy; 2006 IEEE.

Abstract:A two-step modular cluster method for products based on house of quality(HOQ) matrix was proposed to solve the difficulties of extremely vast matrix dimensions in engineering fields. According to engineering performance(EP) correlation matrix, the EPs were first clustered via solving the Fiedler eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector with min-max cut algorithm. Considered the relation matrix of customer requirements (CRs) and EPs and solved a 0-1 optimal problem, the CRs were then clustered with the EPs determined group number, which confirmed the unique and maximum relation criterions; thus the tight coupling customer requirements and engineering performance were clustered into modules. A machine tool case verifies the effectiveness of the proposed approach for modularizing product design

Abstract:The present work tackles a recent problem in the class of cardinality constrained combinatorial optimization problems for the planar graph case: the minimum k-cardinality cut problem. Given an undirected edge-weighted connected graph the min k-cardinality cut problem consists in finding a partition of the vertex set V in two sets V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub> such that the number of the edges between V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> is exactly k and the sum of the weights of these edges is minimal. Although for general graphs the problem is already strongly NP-hard, we have found a pseudopolynomial algorithm for the planar graph case. This algorithm is based on the fact that the min k-cardinality cut problem in the original graph is equivalent to a bi-weighted exact perfect matching problem in a suitable transformation of the geometric dual graph. Because the Lagrangian relaxation of cardinality constraint yields a max cut problem and max cut is polynomially solvable in planar graphs, we also develop a Lagrangian heuristic for the min k-cardinality cut in planar graphs. We compare the performance of this heuristic with the performance of a more general heuristic based on a semidefinite programming relaxation and on the Goemans and Williamson's random hyperplane technique

Abstract:We introduce a method for constructing optimally universal hash families and equivalently RBIBDs. As a consequence of our construction we obtain minimal optimally universal hash families, if the cardinalities of the universe and the range are powers of the same prime. A corollary of this result is that the necessary conditions for the existence of an RBIBD with parameters v,k,&lambda;, namely v&equiv;0 (mod k) and &lambda;(v-1)&equiv;0(mod k-1), are sufficient, if v and <i>k</i> are powers of the same prime. As an application of our construction, we show that the <i>k</i>-MAXCUT algorithm of Hofmeister and Lefmann [A combinatorial design approach to MAXCUT, Random Struct. Algorithms 9 (1996) 163-173] can be implemented such that it has a polynomial running time, in the case that the number of vertices and <i>k</i> are powers of the same prime.

Abstract:The class max (r, 2)-CSP consists of constraint satisfaction problems with at most two r-valued variables per clause. For instances with n variables and m binary clauses, we present an O(r<sub>19m/100</sub>)-time algorithm. It is the fastest algorithm for most problems in the class (including max cut and max 2-sat), and in combination with "Generalized CSPs" introduced in a companion paper, also allows counting, sampling, and the solution of problems like max bisection that escape the usual CSP framework. Linear programming is key to the design as well as the analysis of the algorithm

Abstract:Unique games are constraint satisfaction problems that can be viewed as a generalization of Max-Cut to a larger domain size. The unique games conjecture states that it is hard to distinguish between instances of unique games where almost all constraints are satisfiable and those where almost none are satisfiable. It has been shown to imply a number of inapproximability results for fundamental problems that seem difficult to obtain by more standard complexity assumptions. Thus, proving or refuting this conjecture is an important goal. We present significantly improved approximation algorithms for unique games. For instances with domain size k where the optimal solution satisfies 1 - &epsiv; fraction of all constraints, our algorithms satisfy roughly k<sup>-&epsiv;</sup>(2 - &epsiv;)/ and 1 - O(&radic;&epsiv; log k) fraction of all constraints. Our algorithms are based on rounding a natural semidefinite programming relaxation for the problem and their performance almost matches the integrality gap of this relaxation. Our results are near optimal if the unique games conjecture is true, i.e. any improvement (beyond low order terms) would refute the conjecture

Abstract:We define a distance of two graphs that reflects the closeness of both local and global properties. We also define convergence of a sequence of graphs, and show that a graph sequence is convergent if and only if it is Cauchy in this distance. Every convergent graph sequence has a limit in the form of a symmetric measurable function in two variables. We use these notions of distance and graph limits to give a general theory for parameter testing. As examples, we provide short proofs of the testability of MaxCut and the recent result of Alon and Shapira about the testability of hereditary graph properties

Abstract:Given a set of objects with profits (any, even negative, numbers) assigned not only to separate objects but also to pairs of them, the unconstrained binary quadratic optimization problem consists in finding a subset of objects for which the overall profit is maximized. In this paper, an iterated tabu search algorithm for solving this problem is proposed. Computational results for problem instances of size up to 7000 variables (objects) are reported and comparisons with other up-to-date heuristic methods are provided

Abstract:We present a branch-and-cut algorithm where the volume algorithm is applied instead of the traditionally used dual simplex algorithm to the linear programming relaxations in the root node of the search tree. This means that we use fast approximate solutions to these linear programs instead of exact but slower solutions. We present computational results with the Steiner tree and max-cut problems. We show evidence that one can solve these problems much faster with the volume algorithm based branch-and-cut code than with a dual simplex based one. We discuss when the volume based approach might be more efficient than the simplex based approach

Abstract:In this paper, we proposed an improved discrete Hopfield neural network (DHNN) for Max-Cut problems. By introducing a nonlinear self-feedback term to the motion equation of the DHNN, the DHNN can escape from local minima and therefore get better solutions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has superior ability for Max-Cut problems within reasonable number of iterations. [All rights reserved Elsevier]

Abstract:Several combinatorial optimization problems can be approximated using algorithms based on semidefinite programming. In many of these algorithms a semidefinite relaxation of the underlying problem is solved yielding an optimal vector configuration v<sub>1</sub>,...,v<sub>n</sub>. This vector configuration is then <i>rounded</i> into a {0,1} solution. We present a procedure called RPR<sup>2</sup> (Random Projection followed by Randomized Rounding) for rounding the solution of such semidefinite programs. We show that the <i>random hyperplane</i> rounding technique introduced by Goemans and Williamson, and its variant that involves <i>outward rotation</i>, are both special cases of RPR<sup>2</sup>. We illustrate the use of RPR<sup>2</sup> by presenting two applications. For Max-Bisection we improve the approximation ratio. For Max-Cut, we improve the tradeoff curve (presented by Zwick) that relates the approximation ratio to the size of the maximum cut in a graph. [All rights reserved Elsevier]

Abstract:We consider a generalization of the classical MAX-CUT problem where two objective functions are simultaneously considered. We derive some theorems on the existence and the non-existence of feasible cuts that are at the same time near optimal for both criteria. Furthermore, two approximation algorithms with performance guarantee are presented. The first one is deterministic while the second one is randomized. A generalization of these results is given for the bi-criteria MAX-<i>k</i>-CUT problem. [All rights reserved Elsevier]

Abstract:We investigate solution of the maximum cut problem using a polyhedral cut and price approach. The dual of the well-known SDP relaxation of maxcut is formulated as a semi-infinite linear programming problem, which is solved within an interior point cutting plane algorithm in a dual setting; this constitutes the pricing (column generation) phase of the algorithm. Cutting planes based on the polyhedral theory of the maxcut problem are then added to the primal problem in order to improve the SDP relaxation; this is the cutting phase of the algorithm. We provide computational results, and compare these results with a standard SDP cutting plane scheme

Abstract:We consider a still NP-complete partial case of the unconstrained binary quadratic optimization problem that can be described in terms of an undirected graph with red edges having negative weights and green edges having positive weights. The maximum vertex degree of the graph is three. It can be assumed w.l.o.g. that every vertex is incident to a red and a green edge. We are looking for a vertex cover with respect to the red edges which covers a subset of green edges of total weight as small as possible. We prove that for all connected such graphs except a subclass of special graphs having exactly five green edges it is possible to find a vertex cover with respect to the red edges for which the total weight of uncovered green edges is at least 1/4 fraction of the total weight of all green edges

Abstract:We show that a maximum cut of a random graph below the giant-component threshold can be found in linear space and linear expected time by a simple algorithm. In fact, the algorithm solves a more general class of problems, namely binary 2-variable constraint satisfaction problems. In addition to Max Cut, such Max 2-CSPs encompass Max Dicut, Max 2-Lin, Max 2-Sat, Max-Ones-2-Sat, maximum independent set, and minimum vertex cover. We show that if a Max 2-CSP instance has an 'underlying' graph which is a random graph G&isin;g(n, c/n), then the instance is solved in linear expected time if c&les;1. Moreover, for arbitrary values (or functions) c&gt;1 an instance is solved in expected time nexp(O(1+(c-1)<sup>3</sup>n)): in the 'scaling window' c=1+&lambda;n<sup>-1/3</sup> with &lambda; fixed, this expected time remains linear. Our method is to show, first, that if a Max 2-CSP has a connected underlying graph with n vertices and m edges, then O(n2<sup>(m-n)</sup>/2) is a deterministic upper bound on the solution time. Then, analysing the tails of the distribution of this quantity for a component of a random graph yields our result. Towards this end we derive some useful properties of binomial distributions and simple random walks

Abstract:Resolving local ambiguities in an important issue for shape from shading (SFS). Pixel ambiguities of SFS can be eliminated by propagation approaches. However, patch ambiguities still exist. Therefore, we formulate the global disambiguation problem to resolve these ambiguities. Intuitively, it can he interpreted as flipping patches and adjusting heights such that the result surface has no kinks. The problem is intractable because exponentially many possible configurations need to be checked. Alternatively, we solve the integrability testing problem closely related to the original one. It can be viewed as finding a surface which satisfies the global integrability constraint. To encode the constraints, we introduce a graph formulation called configuration graph. Searching the solution on this graph can be reduced to a Max-cut problem and its solution is computable using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. Tests carried out on synthetic and real images show that the global disambiguation works well for complex shapes. &copy; 2006 IEEE.

Abstract:Many lower bound computation methods for branch and bound Max-SAT solvers can be explained as procedures that search for disjoint inconsistent subformulas in the Max-SAT instance under consideration. The difference among them is the technique used to detect inconsistencies. In this paper, we define five new lower bound computation methods: two of them are based on detecting inconsistencies via a unit propagation procedure that propagates unit clauses using an original ordering; the other three add an additional level of forward look-ahead based on detecting failed literals. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the new lower bounds are of better quality than the existing lower bounds, as well as that a solver with our new lower bounds greatly outperforms some of the best performing state-of-the-art Max-SAT solvers on Max-2SAT, Max-3SAT, and Max-Cut instances.

Abstract:Constraint satisfaction problems, more simply called CSPs are central in computer science, the most famous probably being Satisfiability, SAT, the basic NP-complete problem. In this talk we survey some results about the optimization version of CSPs where we want to satisfy as many constraints as possible. One very simple approach to a CSP is to give random values to the variables. It turns out that for some CSPs, one example being Max-3Sat, unless P=NP, there is no polynomial time algorithm that can achieve a an approximation ratio that is superior to what is obtained by this trivial strategy. Some other CSPs, Max-Cut being a prime example, do allow very interesting non-trivial approximation algorithms which do give an approximation ratio that is substantially better than that obtained by a random assignment. These results hint at a general classification problem of determining which CSPs do admit a polynomial time approximation algorithm that beats the random assignment by a constant factor. Positive results giving such algorithms tend to be based on semi-definite programming while the PCP theorem is the central tool for proving negative result. We describe many of the known results in the area and also discuss some of the open problems. &copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

Abstract:The rise of convex programming has changed the face of many research fields in recent years, machine learning being one of the ones that benefitted the most. A very recent developement, the relaxation of combinatorial problems to semi-definite programs (SDP), has gained considerable attention over the last decade (Helmberg, 2000; De Bie and Cristianini, 2004a). Although SDP problems can be solved in polynomial time, for many relaxations the exponent in the polynomial complexity bounds is too high for scaling to large problem sizes. This has hampered their uptake as a powerful new tool in machine learning. In this paper, we present a new and fast SDP relaxation of the normalized graph cut problem, and investigate its usefulness in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. In particular, this provides a convex algorithm for transduction, as well as approaches to clustering. We further propose a whole cascade of fast relaxations that all hold the middle between older spectral relaxations and the new SDP relaxation, allowing one to trade off computational cost versus relaxation accuracy. Finally, we discuss how the methodology developed in this paper can be applied to other combinatorial problems in machine learning, and we treat the max-cut problem as an example.

Abstract:We present a genetic model based on simulated recombination of fixed sequences of quaternary genes (assuming four distinct forms, or alleles). States and dynamics of the infinite population genetic system, represented by the model, are derived for quadratic fitness functions. The bivariate marginal distribution genetic algorithm, devised to simulate the system, is experimentally compared with the univariate marginal distribution genetic algorithm with bit-based simulated crossover (in the case of infinite populations) for the MAX - CUT problem.

Abstract:We give a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm which for any given average degree d and asymptotically almost all random graphs G in g(n, m = [d/2n]) outputs a cut of G whose ratio (in cardinality) with the maximum cut is at least 0.952. We remind the reader that it is known that unless P=NP, for no constant e &gt; 0 is there a MAX-CUT approximation algorithm that for all inputs achieves an approximation ratio of (16/17) + &Epsilon; (16/17 &lt; 0.94118). &copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

Abstract:The UNIQUE GAMES problem is the following: we are given a graph G = (V, E), with each edge e = (u, v) having a weight w<inf>e</inf> and a permutation &pi;<inf>uv</inf> on [k]. The objective is to find a labeling of each vertex u with a label f<inf>u</inf> &isin; [k] to minimize the weight of unsatisfied edges - where an edge (u, v) is satisfied if f<inf>v</inf> = &pi;<inf>uv</inf>(f<inf>u</inf>). The Unique Games Conjecture of Khot [8] essentially says that for each &Epsilon; &gt; 0, there is a k such that it is NP-hard to distinguish instances of Unique games with (1-&Epsilon;) satisfiable edges from those with only &Epsilon; satisfiable edges. Several hardness results have recently been proved based on this assumption, including optimal ones for Max-Cut, Vertex-Cover and other problems, making it an important challenge to prove or refute the conjecture. In this paper, we give an O(log n)-approximation algorithm for the problem of minimizing the number of unsatisfied edges in any Unique game. Previous results of Khot [8] and Trevisan [12] imply that if the optimal solution has OPT = &Epsilon;m unsatisfied edges, semidefinite relaxations of the problem could give labelings with min{k<sup>2</sup>&Epsilon;<sup>1/5</sup>, (&Epsilon; log n)<sup>1/2</sup>}m unsatisfied edges. In this paper we show how to round a LP relaxation to get an O(log n)-approximation to the problem; i.e., to find a labeling with only O(&Epsilon;m log n) = O(OPT log n) unsatisfied edges.

Abstract:This paper considers the distribution of values Q(x), x &isin; {-1, 1} <sup>n</sup>, where Q is a quadratic form in n variables with real coefficients. Error estimates are established for approximations of the maximum and minimum values of Q on {-1, 1}<sup>n</sup> which can be obtained by semidefinite programming. Bounds are given involving the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal entries. Other bounds are given which are useful in the case of extreme skewness. Used in conjunction with earlier bounds of Nesterov in [Optim. Methods Softw., 9 (1998), pp. 141-160], these new bounds lead to improvements on the bound given by the trace. The trigonometric description of the maximum and minimum given in [Optim. Methods Softw., 9 (1998), pp. 141-160], which is based on the rounding argument introduced by Goemans and Williamson in [J. Assoc. Comput. Mach., 6 (1995), pp. 1115-1145], is a major tool in obtaining these bounds. &copy; 2005 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

Abstract:We propose a dynamic version of the bundle method to get approximate solutions to semidefinite programs with a nearly arbitrary number of linear inequalities. Our approach is based on Lagrangian duality, where the inequalities are dualized, and only a basic set of constraints is maintained explicitly. This leads to function evaluations requiring to solve a relatively simple semidefinite program. Our approach provides accurate solutions to semidefinite relaxations of the Max-Cut and the Equipartition problem, which are not achievable by direct approaches based only on interior-point methods.

Abstract:The max-cut and stable set problems are two fundamental [InlineMediaObject not available: see fulltext.]-hard problems in combinatorial optimization. It has been known for a long time that any instance of the stable set problem can be easily transformed into a max-cut instance. Moreover, Laurent, Poljak, Rendl and others have shown that any convex set containing the cut polytope yields, via a suitable projection, a convex set containing the stable set polytope. We review this work, and then extend it in the following ways. We show that the rounded version of certain 'positive semidefinite' inequalities for the cut polytope imply, via the same projection, a surprisingly large variety of strong valid inequalities for the stable set polytope. These include the clique, odd hole, odd antihole, web and antiweb inequalities, and various inequalities obtained from these via sequential lifting. We also examine a less general class of inequalities for the cut polytope, which we call odd clique inequalities, and show that they are, in general, much less useful for generating valid inequalities for the stable set polytope. As well as being of theoretical interest, these results have algorithmic implications. In particular, we obtain as a by-product a polynomial-time separation algorithm for a class of inequalities which includes all web inequalities.

Abstract:We present a novel method for exactly solving (in fact, counting solutions to) general constraint satisfaction optimization with at most two variables per constraint (e.g. MAX-2-CSP and MIN-2-CSP), which gives the first exponential improvement over the trivial algorithm. More precisely, the runtime bound is a constant factor improvement in the base of the exponent: the algorithm can count the number of optima in MAX-2-SAT and MAX-CUT instances in <i>O</i>(<i>m</i><sup>3</sup>2<sup>&omega;n/3</sup>) time, where <i>&omega;</i>&lt;2.376 is the matrix product exponent over a ring. When the constraints have arbitrary weights, there is a (1+<i>&epsi;</i>)-approximation with roughly the same runtime, modulo polynomial factors. Our construction shows that improvement in the runtime exponent of either <i>k</i>-<i>clique</i> solution (even when <i>k</i>=3) or <i>matrix multiplication over</i>GF(2) would improve the runtime exponent for solving 2-CSP optimization. Our approach also yields connections between the complexity of some (polynomial time) high-dimensional search problems and some NP-hard problems. For example, if there are sufficiently faster algorithms for computing the diameter of <i>n</i> points in &lscr;<sub>1</sub>, then there is an (2-<i>&epsi;</i>)<sup>n</sup> algorithm for MAX-LIN. These results may be construed as either lower bounds on the high-dimensional problems, or hope that better algorithms exist for the corresponding hard problems. [All rights reserved Elsevier]

Abstract:This paper presents a smoothing heuristic for an NP-hard combinatorial problem. Starting with a convex Lagrangian relaxation, a pathfollowing method is applied to obtain good solutions while gradually transforming the relaxed problem into the original problem formulated with an exact penalty function. Starting points are drawn using different sampling techniques that use randomization and eigenvectors. The dual point that defines the convex relaxation is computed via eigenvalue optimization using subgradient techniques. The proposed method turns out to be competitive with the most recent ones. The idea presented here is generic and can be generalized to all box-constrained problems where convex Lagrangian relaxation can be applied. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a Lagrangian heuristic is combined with pathfollowing techniques

Abstract:The vertex coloring problem has been the subject of extensive research for many years. Driven by application potential as well as computational challenge, a variety of methods have been proposed for this difficult class of problems. Recent successes in the use of the unconstrained quadratic programming (UQP) model as a unified framework for modeling and solving combinatorial optimization problems have motivated a new approach to the vertex coloring problem. In this paper we present a UQP approach to this problem and illustrate its attractiveness with preliminary computational experience

Abstract:We prove that given a graph, one can efficiently find a set of no more than m/5.217 + 1 nodes whose removal yields a partial two-tree. As an application, we immediately get simple algorithms for several problems, including Max-Cut, Max-2-SAT and Max-2-XSAT. All of these takes a record-breaking time of O*(2<sup>m/5.217</sup>), where m is the number of clauses or edges, while only using polynomial space. Moreover, the existence of the aforementioned node sets implies an upper bound of m/5.217 + 3 on the treewidth of a graph with m edges. Letting go of polynomial space restrictions, this can be improved to a bound of m/5.769 + O(log n) on the pathwidth, leading to algorithms for the above problems that take O*(2<sup>m/5.769</sup>) time

Abstract:We develop efficient exact algorithms for several NP-hard problems including vertex bipartization, feedback vertex set, 4-hitting set, and max cut in graphs with maximum degree at most 4. Our main results include: an O<sup>*</sup> (1.9526<sup>n</sup>) algorithm for Vertex Bipartization problem in undirected graphs; an O<sup>*</sup> (1.8384<sup>n</sup>) algorithm for vertex bipartization problem in undirected graphs of maximum degree 3; an O<sup>*</sup>(1.945<sup>n</sup>) algorithm for feedback vertex set and vertex bipartization problem in undirected graphs of maximum degree 4; an O<sup>*</sup>(1.9799<sup>n</sup>) algorithm for 4-hitting set problem; an O<sup>*</sup> (1.5541<sup>m</sup>) algorithm for feedback arc set problem in tournaments. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best known exact algorithms for these problems. In fact, these are the first exact algorithms for these problems with the base of the exponent &lt; 2. En route to these algorithms, we introduce two general techniques for obtaining exact algorithms. One is through parameterized complexity algorithms, and the other is a 'colored' branch-and-bound technique

Abstract:Summary form only given. The discovery of the PCP theorem in 1992 led to an avalanche of hardness of approximation results, i.e. results showing that for certain NP hard optimization problems, computing even approximate solutions is hard. However, for many fundamental problems, obtaining satisfactory hardness results seems out of reach of current techniques. The unique games conjecture (UGC) was proposed in 2002 as an approach towards settling some of these open problems. A 2-Prover-1-Round game is called unique if for every answer of either prover, there is exactly one answer of the other prover if the verifier is to accept. The UGC states that for every constant &epsiv; &gt; 0, it is NP hard to distinguish whether the optimal strategy of provers in a unique 2P1R game has acceptance probability at least 1 - &epsiv; or at most &epsiv;. The answer size k = k(&epsiv;) could be an arbitrary function of &epsiv;. The UGC has been shown to imply optimal hardness results for vertex cover and MAX-CUT problems, and superconstant hardness results for sparsest cut and Min-2SAT-Deletion problems. A variation of the conjecture has been shown to imply hardness of coloring 3-colorable graphs with constantly many colors. Apart from these applications to hardness results, the UGC has led to important (unconditional) results in Fourier analysis, the theory of metric embeddings, and integrality gap results for semidefinite programming relaxations. The tutorial aims to give an overview of the UGC, its applications, and attempts to prove or disprove it

Abstract:We study three new techniques that will speed up the branch-and-bound algorithm for the MAX-2-SAT problem: The first technique is a group of new lower bound functions for the algorithm and we show that these functions are admissible and consistently better than other known lower bound functions. The other two techniques are based on the strongly connected components of the implication graph of a 2CNF formula: one uses the graph to simplify the formula and the other uses the graph to design a new variable ordering. The experiments show that the simplification can reduce the size of the input substantially no matter what is the clause-to-variable ratio and that the new variable ordering performs much better when the clause-to-variable ratio is less than 2. A direct outcome of this research is a high-performance implementation of an exact algorithm for MAX-2-SAT which outperforms any implementation we know about in the same category. We also show that our implementation is a feasible and effective tool to solve large instances of the Max-Cut problem in graph theory

Abstract:For a graph G, let f(G) denote the maximum number of edges in a cut of G. For an integer m and for a fixed graph H, let f(m,H) denote the minimum possible cardinality of f(G), as G ranges over all graphs on m edges that contain no copy of H. In this paper we study this function for various graphs H. In particular we show that for any graph H obtained by connecting a single vertex to all vertices of a fixed nontrivial forest, there is a c(H) &gt; 0 such that f(m, H) &ges; m/2+c(H)m<sup>4/5</sup>, and that this is tight up to the value of c(H). We also prove that for any even cycle C<sub>2k</sub> there is a c(k) &gt; 0 such that f(m,C<sub>2k</sub>)&ges;m/2+c(k)m<sup>(2k+1)</sup>(2k+2)/, and that this is tight, up to the value of c(k), for 2k &isin; {4,6,10}. The proofs combine combinatorial, probabilistic and spectral techniques

Abstract:The number partitioning problem has proven to be a challenging problem for both exact and heuristic solution methods. We present a new modeling and solution approach that consists of recasting the problem as an unconstrained quadratic binary program that can be solved by efficient metaheuristic methods. Our approach readily accommodates both the common two-subset partition case as well as the more general case of multiple subsets. Preliminary computational experience is presented illustrating the attractiveness of the method

Abstract:Let A be a real symmetric n &times; n-matrix with eigenvalues &lambda;<sub>1</sub>, ..., &lambda;<sub>n</sub> ordered after decreasing absolute value, and b an n &times; 1-vector. We present an algorithm finding approximate solutions to min x* (Ax + b) and max x* (Ax + b) over x &epsi; {-1, 1}<sup>n</sup>, with an absolute error of at most (c<sub>1</sub> |&lambda;| + |&lambda;<sub>&lceil;c2</sub> log n&rceil;|)2n + O((&alpha;n + &beta;)&radic;n log n), where &alpha; and &beta; are the largest absolute values of the entries in A and b, respectively, for any positive constants c<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>2</sub>, in time polynomial in n. We demonstrate that the algorithm yields a PTAS for MAXCUT in regular graphs on n vertices of degree d of &omega;(&radic;n log n), as long as they contain O(d<sup>4</sup> log n) 4-cycles. The strongest previous result showed that &Omega;(n/log n) average degree graphs admit a PTAS. We also show that smooth n-variate polynomial integer programs of constant degree k, always can be approximated in polynomial time leaving an absolute error of o(n<sup>k</sup>), answering in the affirmative a suspicion of Arora, Karger, and Karpinski in STOC 1995

Abstract:We present two results on derandomization of randomized algorithms. The first result is a derandomization of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma based randomized dimensionality reduction algorithm. Our algorithm is simpler and faster than known algorithms. It is based on deriving a pessimistic estimator of the probability of failure. The second result is a general technique for derandomizing semidefinite programming (SDP) based approximation algorithms. We apply this technique to the randomized algorithm for Max Cut. Once again the algorithm is faster than known deterministic algorithms for the same approximation ratio. For this problem we present a technique to approximate probabilities with bounded error

Abstract:Satisfiability (SAT) and Max-SAT problems have been the object of considerable research effort over the past few decades. They remain a very important research area today due to their computational challenge and application importance. In this paper we investigate the use of penalty functions to recast SAT problems into the modelling framework offered by the unconstrained quadratic binary program. Computational experience is presented, illustrating how promising this approach is for Max 2-Sat problems

Abstract:The Max-Cut problem consists of finding a partition of the graph nodes into two subsets, such that the sum of the edge weights having endpoints in different subsets is maximized, This NP-hard problem for non planar graphs has different applications in areas such as VLSI and ASIC design, This paper proposes an evolutionary hybrid algorithm based on low-level hybridization between Memetic Algorithms and Variable Neighborhood Search, This algorithm is tested and compared with the results, found in the bibliography, obtained by other hybrid metaheuristics for the same problem. Achieved experimental results show the suitability of the approach, and that the proposed hybrid evolutionary algorithm finds near-optimal solutions, Moreover, on a set of standard test problems, new best known solutions were produced for several instances.

Abstract:This paper proposes a novel temporal data segmentation approach based on a graph partition model. To find the optimal segmentation, which maintains maximal connectivity within the same segment while keeping minimum association between different ones, we adopt the min-max cut as an objective function. For temporal data, a linear time algorithm is designed by importing the temporal constraints. With multi-pair comparison strategy, the proposed method is more robust than the existing pair-wise comparison ones. The experiments on TRECVID benchmarking platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. &copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

Abstract:Lova&acute;sz and Schrijver described a generic method of tightening the LP and SDP relaxation for any 0-1 optimization problem. These tightened relaxations were the basis of several celebrated approximation algorithms (such as for MAX-CUT, MAX-3SAT. and SPARSEST CUT). We prove strong inapproximability results in this model for well-known problems such as MAX-3SAT, HYPERGRAPH VERTEX COVER and SET COVER. We show that the relaxations produced by as many as &Omega;(n) rounds of the LS<inf>+</inf> procedure do not allow nontrivial approximation, thus ruling out the possibility that the LS<inf>+</inf> approach gives even slightly subexponential approximation algorithms for these problems. We also point out why our results are somewhat incomparable to known inapproximability results proved using PCPs, and formalize several interesting open questions. Copyright 2005 ACM.

Abstract:A dynamic geometric data stream consists of a sequence of m insert/delete operations of points from the discrete space {1,..., &Delta;}<sup>d</sup> [26]. We develop streaming (1 + &Epsilon;)-approximation algorithms for k-median, k-means, MaxCut, maximum weighted matching (MaxWM), maximum travelling salesperson (MaxTSP), maximum spanning tree (MaxST), and average distance over dynamic geometric data streams. Our algorithms maintain a small weighted set of points (a coreset) that approximates with probability 2/3 the current point set with respect to the considered problem during the m insert/delete operations of the data stream. They use poly(&Epsilon;<sup>-1</sup>, log m, log &Delta;) space and update time per insert/delete operation for constant le and dimension d. Having a coreset one only needs a fast approximation algorithm for the weighted problem to compute a solution quickly. In fact, even an exponential algorithm is sometimes feasible as its running time may still be polynomial in n. For example one can compute in poly(log n,exp(O((1 + log(1/&Epsilon;)/&Epsilon;) <sup>d-1</sup>))) time a solution to k-median and k-means [21] where n is the size of the current point set and k and d are constants. Finding an implicit solution to MaxCut can be done in poly(log n,exp((1/&Epsilon;)<sup>o (1)</sup>)) time. For MaxST and average distance we require poly(log n, &Epsilon; <sup>-1</sup>) time and for MaxWM we require O(n<sup>3</sup>) time to do this. Copyright 2005 ACM.

Abstract:Goemans and Williamson obtained an approximation algorithm for the MAX CUT problem with a performance ratio of &alpha;<sub>GW</sub> &sime; 0.87856. Their algorithm starts by solving a standard SDP relaxation of MAX CUT and then rounds the optimal solution obtained using a random hyperplane. In some cases, the optimal solution of the SDP relaxation happens to lie in a low dimensional space. Can an improved performance ratio be obtained for such instances? We show that the answer is yes in dimensions two and three and conjecture that this is also the case in any higher fixed dimension. In two dimensions an optimal 32/(25+5&radic;5)-approximation algorithm was already obtained by Goemans. (Note that 32/(25+5&radic;5) &sime; 0.88456.) We obtain an alternative derivation of this result using Gegenbauer polynomials. Our main result is an improved rounding procedure for SDP solutions that lie in R<sup>3</sup> with a performance ratio of about 0.8818. The rounding procedure uses an interesting yin-yan coloring of the three dimensional sphere. The improved performance ratio obtained resolves, in the negative, an open problem posed by Feige and Schechtman [STOC'01]. They asked whether there are MAX CUT instances with integrality ratios arbitrarily close to &alpha;<sub>GW</sub> &sime; 0.87856 that have optimal embedding, i.e., optimal solutions of their SDP relaxations, that lie in R<sup>3</sup>

Abstract:"Lift-and-project" procedures, which tighten linear relaxations over many rounds, yield many of the celebrated approximation algorithms of the past decade or so, even after only a constant number of rounds (e.g., for max-CUT, max-3sat and sparsest-cut). Thus proving super-constant round lowerbounds on such procedures may provide evidence about the inapproximability of a problem. We prove an integrality gap of k-&epsiv; for linear relaxations obtained from the trivial linear relaxation for k-uniform hypergraph VERTEX COVER by applying even &Omega;(log log n) rounds of Lovasz and Schrijver's LS lift-and-project procedure. In contrast, known PCP-based results only rule out k - 1 - &epsiv; approximations. Our gaps are tight since the trivial linear relaxation gives a k-approximation

Abstract:This paper mainly focuses on a new continuous method for solving multiuser detection in CDMA using the NCP function. This approach is completely different from the relaxation method in the sense that it is an equivalent conversion. The resulting nonlinear programming problem of multiuser detection is then solved using the augmented Lagrange penalty function method. The convergence property of the proposed algorithm is studied, and numerical experiments show this method is very effective

Abstract:We address the weighted max-cut problem, or equivalently the problem of maximizing a quadratic form in <i>n</i> binary variables. If the underlying (symmetric) matrix is positive semidefinite of fixed rank <i>d</i>, then the problem can be reduced to searching the extreme points of a zonotope, thus becoming of polynomial complexity in O(<i>n</i><sup>d-1</sup>). Reverse search is an efficient and practical means for enumerating the cells of a regular hyperplane arrangement, or equivalently, the extreme points of a zonotope. We present an enhanced version of reverse search of significantly reduced computational complexity that uses ray shooting and is well suited for parallel computation. Furthermore, a neighborhood zonotope edge following descent heuristic can be devised. We report preliminary computational experiments of a parallel implementation of our algorithms.

Abstract:We describe the semidefinite analog of the vector packing problem, and show that the semidefinite programming relaxations for MAXCUT and graph coloring are in this class of problems. We extend. a method of Bienstock and Iyengar (2004) which was based on ideas from Nesterov (2003) to design an algorithm for computing &epsi;-approximate solutions for this class of semidefinite programs. Our algorithm is in the spirit of Klein and Lu (1996), and decreases the dependence of the run-time on &epsi; from &epsi;<sup>-2</sup> to &epsi;<sup>-1</sup>. For sparse graphs, our method is faster than the best specialized interior point methods. A significant feature of our method is that it treats both the MAXCUT and the graph coloring problem in a unified manner

Abstract:In this work, the well-known graph partitioning (GP) problem for undirected weighted graphs has been studied from two points of view: maximizing (MaxCut) or minimizing (MinCut) the cost of the cut induced in the graph by the partition. A unified model, based on a neural technique for optimization problems, has been applied to these two concrete problems. A detailed description of the model is presented, and the technique to minimize an energy function, that measures the goodness of solutions, is fully described. Some techniques to escape from local optima are presented as well. It has proved to be a very competitive and efficient algorithm, in terms of quality of solutions and computational time, when compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Some simulation results are presented in this paper, to show the comparative efficiency of the methods

Abstract:We show that an LC parametric transducer can be effectively used to monitor an adiabatic evolution of the superconducting flux qubit. We propose a scheme to measure the qubit's state, which is a quantum nondemolition measurement. The scheme can be easily extended to a three-qubit system and allows the reading out of the qubits' states while the system remains in the ground state. An implementation of the adiabatic quantum algorithm MAXCUT for three superconducting flux qubits is discussed

Abstract:The semimetric polytope is an important polyhedral structure lying at the heart of several hard combinatorial problems. Therefore, linear optimization over the semimetric polytope is crucial for a number of relevant applications. Building on some recent polyhedral and algorithmic results about a related polyhedron, the rooted semimetric polytope, we develop and test several approaches, based over Lagrangian relaxation and application of Non Differentiable Optimization algorithms, for linear optimization over the semimetric polytope. We show that some of these approaches can obtain very accurate primal and dual solutions in a small fraction of the time required for the same task by state-of-the-art general purpose linear programming technology. In some cases, good estimates of the dual optimal solution (but not of the primal solution) can be obtained even quicker. &copy; Springer-Verlag 2005.

Abstract:Data declustering is an important issue for reducing query response times in multi-disk database systems. In this paper, we propose a declustering method that utilizes the available information on query distribution, data distribution, data-item sizes, and disk capacity constraints. The proposed method exploits the natural correspondence between a data set with a given query distribution and a hypergraph. We define an objective function that exactly represents the aggregate parallel query-response time for the declustering problem and adapt the iterative-improvement-based heuristics successfully used in hypergraph partitioning to this objective function. We propose a two-phase algorithm that first obtains an initial K-way declustering by recursively bipartitioning the data set, then applies multi-way refinement on this declustering. We provide effective gain models and efficient implementation schemes for both phases. The experimental results on a wide range of realistic data sets show that the proposed method provides a significant performance improvement compared with the state-of-the-art declustering strategy based on similarity-graph partitioning. &copy; 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract:Memetic algorithms (MAs) have demonstrated very effective in combinatorial optimization. This paper offers explanations as to why this is so by investigating the performance of MAs in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. A special class of MAs is used to discuss efficiency and effectiveness for local search and evolutionary meta-search. It is shown that the efficiency of MAs can be increased drastically with the use of domain knowledge. However, effectiveness highly depends on the structure of the problem. As is well-known, identifying this structure is made easier with the notion of fitness landscapes: the local properties of the fitness landscape strongly influence the effectiveness of the local search while the global properties strongly influence the effectiveness of the evolutionary meta-search. This paper also introduces new techniques for analyzing the fitness landscapes of combinatorial problems; these techniques focus on the investigation of random walks in the fitness landscape starting at locally optimal solutions as well as on the escape from the basins of attractions of current local optima. It is shown for NK-landscapes and landscapes of the unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem (BQP) that a random walk to another local optimum can be used to explain the efficiency of recombination in comparison to mutation. Moreover, the paper shows that other aspects like the size of the basins of attractions of local optima are important for the efficiency of MAs and a local search escape analysis is proposed. These simple analysis techniques have several advantages over previously proposed statistical measures and provide valuable insight into the behaviour of MAs on different kinds of landscapes.

Abstract:We apply techniques from the theory of approximation algorithms to the problem of deciding whether a random k-SAT formula is satisfiable. Let Form <sub>n,k,m</sub> denote a random k-SAT instance with n variables and m clauses. Using known approximation algorithms for MAX CUT or MIN BISECTION, we show how to certify that Form <sub>n,4,m</sub> is unsatisfiable efficiently, provided that m&ges;Cn<sup>2</sup> for a sufficiently large constant C&gt;0. In addition, we present an algorithm based on the Lovasz &thetav; function that decides within polynomial expected time whether Form <sub>n,k,m</sub>is satisfiable, provided that k is even and m&ges;C&middot;4<sup>k</sup>n<sup>k/2</sup>. Finally, we present an algorithm that approximates random MAX 2-SAT on input Form <sub>n,2,m</sub> within a factor of 1-O(n/m)<sup>1/2</sup> in expected polynomial time, for m&ges;Cn.

Abstract:With random inputs, certain decision problems undergo a "phase transition." We prove similar behavior in an optimization context. Given a conjunctive normal form (CNF) formula F on n variables and with m k-variable clauses, denote by max F the maximum number of clauses satisfiable by a single assignment of the variables. (Thus the decision problem k-SAT is to determine if max F is equal to m). With the formula F chosen at random, the expectation of max F is trivially bounded by (3/4)m&les;E max F&les;m. We prove that for random formulas with m=&lfloor;cn&rfloor; clauses: for constants c&lt;1, E max F is &lfloor;cn&rfloor;-&Theta;(1/n); for large c, it approaches ((3/4)c+&Theta;(&radic;c))n; and in the "window" c=1+&Theta;(n<sup>-1/3</sup>), it is cn-&Theta;(1). Our full results are more detailed, but this already shows that the optimization problem MAX 2-SAT undergoes a phase transition just as the 2-SAT decision problem does, and at the same critical value c=1. Most of our results are established without reference to the analogous propositions for decision 2-SAT, and can be used to reproduce them. We consider "online" versions of MAX 2-SAT, and show that for one version the obvious greedy algorithm is optimal; all other natural questions remain open. We can extend only our simplest MAX 2-SAT results to MAX k-SAT, but we conjecture a "MAX k-SAT limiting function conjecture" analogous to the folklore "satisfiability threshold conjecture," but open even for k=2. Neither conjecture immediately implies the other, but it is natural to further conjecture a connection between them. We also prove analogous results for random MAX CUT

Abstract:In this paper a preprocessing algorithm for unconstrained mixed integer quadratic programming problems and binary quadratic programming problems is presented. The optimal value for some or all integer variables can be computed without approximations in polynomial time. The algorithm is first derived for the binary quadratic programming problem and the result is then extended to the mixed integer quadratic programming problem by transforming the latter problem into the first problem. Both mentioned quadratic programming problems have several important applications. In this paper, the focus is on model predictive control problems with both real-valued and binary control signals. As an illustration of the method, the algorithm is applied to two different problems of this type

Abstract:This paper considers the following type of quadratic programming problem. Given an arbitrary matrix A, whose diagonal elements are zero, find x &isin; {-1, 1}<sup>n</sup> such that x<sup>T</sup>Ax is maximized. Our approximation algorithm for this problem uses the canonical semidefinite relaxation and returns a solution whose ratio to the optimum is in &Omega;(1/ logn). This quadratic programming problem can be seen as an extension to that of maximizing x<sup>T</sup>Ay (where y's components are also &plusmn;1). Grothendieck's inequality states that the ratio of the optimum value of the latter problem to the optimum of its canonical semidefinite relaxation is bounded below by a constant. The study of this type of quadratic program arose from a desire to approximate the maximum correlation in correlation clustering. Nothing substantive was known about this problem; we present an &Omega; (1/logn) approximation, based on our quadratic programming algorithm. We can also guarantee that our quadratic programming algorithm returns a solution to the MAXCUT problem that has a significant advantage over a random assignment

Abstract:This paper presents a new approach called Hierarchical Support Vector Machines (HSVM), to address multiclass problems. The method solves a series of maxcut problems to hierarchically and recursively partition the set of classes into two-subsets, till pure leaf nodes that have only one class label, are obtained. The SVM is applied at each internal node to construct the discriminant function for a binary metaclass classifier. Because maxcut unsupervised decomposition uses distance measures to investigate the natural class groupings. HSVM has a fast and intuitive SVM training process that requires little tuning and yields both high accuracy levels and good generalization. The HSVM method was applied to Hyperion hyperspectral data collected over the Okavango Delta of Botswana. Classification accuracies and generalization capability are compared to those achieved by the Best Basis Binary Hierarchical Classifier, a Random Forest CART binary decision tree classifier and Binary Hierarchical Support Vector Machines

Abstract:This paper describes and experimentally compares five rather different multistart tabu search strategies for the unconstrained binary quadratic optimization problem, a random restart procedure, an application of a deterministic heuristic to specially constructed subproblems, an application of a randomized procedure to the full problem, a constructive procedure using tabu search adaptive memory, and an approach based on solving perturbed problems. In the solution improvement phase a modification of a standard tabu search implementation is used. A computational trick applied to this modification - mapping of the current solution to the zero vector - allowed to significantly reduce the time complexity of the search. Computational results are provided for the 25 largest problem instances from the OR-Library and, in addition, for the 18 randomly generated larger and more dense problems. For 9 instances from the OR-Library new best solutions were found

Abstract:We present a method for exactly solving (in fact, counting solutions to) general constraint satisfaction optimization with at most two variables per constraint (e.g. MAX-2-CSP and MIN-2-CSP), which gives the first exponential improvement over the trivial algorithm. More precisely, the runtime bound has a constant factor improvement in the base of the exponent: the algorithm can count the number of optima in MAX-2-SAT and MAX-CUT instances in O(m<sup>3</sup>2<sup>wn/3</sup>) time, where w &gt; 2.376 is the matrix product exponent over a ring. When constraints have arbitrary weights, there is a (1+&epsiv;)-approximation with roughly the same runtime, modulo polynomial factors. Our construction shows that improvement in the runtime exponent of either k-clique solution (even when k = 3) or matrix multiplication over GF(2) would improve the runtime exponent for solving 2-CSP optimization. The overall approach also yields connections between the complexity of some (polynomial time) high dimensional search problems and some NP-hard problems. For example, if there are sufficiently faster algorithms for computing the diameter of n points in &lscr;<sub>1</sub>, then there is an (2-&epsiv;)<sup>n</sup> algorithm for MAX-LIN. These results may be construed as either lower bounds on the high-dimensional problems, or hope that better algorithms exist for the corresponding hard problems

Abstract:The paper deals with the problem of finding efficient algorithms to optimize a linear function over such a polytope. The paper briefly mentions two reasons to seek for an efficient way to optimize a linear function over M(G). The first is the polytope M(G), for |V| &gt; 4, properly contains the cut polytope associated with G. Thus, if an edge cost function c &isin; &Ropf;<sup>E</sup> is given, maximizing c over M(G) produces an upper bound on the maximum c-value cut of G, which can be exploited in branch and bound or branch and cut schemes for solving max-cut to optimality. The second is if an edge capacity function c &isin; &Ropf;<sup>E</sup> and an edge demand function d &isin; &Ropf;<sup>E</sup> are given, the existence of a feasible multiflow in the network defined by G, c, and d is established by the Japanese theorem

Abstract:The simple max-cut problem is as follows: given a graph, find a partition of its vertex set into two disjoint sets, such that the number of edges having one endpoint in each set is as large as possible. A split graph is a graph whose vertex set admits a partition into a stable set and a clique. The simple max-cut decision problem is known to be NP-complete for split graphs. An indifference graph is the intersection graph of a set of unit intervals of the real line. We show that the simple max-cut problem can be solved in linear time for a graph that is both split and indifference. Moreover, we also show that for each constant q, the simple max-cut problem can be solved in polynomial time for (q, q - 4)-graphs. These are graphs for which no set of at most q vertices induces more than q - 4 distinct P<sub>4</sub>'s

Abstract:We examine the periodic nature of detailed structure (particularly dips) in the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer/All Sky Monitor (RXTE/ASM) light-curve of Circinus X-1. The significant phase wandering of the X-ray maxima suggests their identification with the response on a viscous time-scale of the accretion disc to perturbation. We find that the X-ray dips provide a more accurate system clock than the maxima, and thus use these as indicators of the times of periastron passage. We fit a quadratic ephemeris to these dips, and find its predictive power for the X-ray light-curve to be superior to ephemerides based on the radio flares and the full archival X-ray light-curve. Under the hypothesis that the dips are tracers of the mass transfer rate from the donor, we use their occurrence rate as a function of orbital phase to explore the (as yet unconstrained) nature of the donor. The high term in the ephemeris provides another piece of evidence which shows that Cir X-1 is in a state of dynamical evolution, and thus is a very young post-supernova system. We further suggest that the radio 'synchrotron nebula' immediately surrounding Cir X-1 is, in fact, the remnant of the event that created the compact object, and discuss briefly the evidence for and against such an interpretation

Abstract:In the current Internet, there are two main types of intra-domain multicast routing protocols: dense mode and sparse mode. Dense mode protocols construct shortest path trees from the sender to the receivers. Sparse mode protocols construct shared trees rooted at a certain router, called core or rendezvous point (RP), which acts as a meeting point between senders and receivers of the same group. While solving important scalability problems in wide area networks, shared trees also bring some drawbacks, the most known of which are traffic concentration and delay. In order to minimize these kinds of drawbacks, a variant of sparse mode using several cores per group emerged. Receivers are attached to the closest core and sources send packets to all the cores with attached receivers of the corresponding group. In this paper three clustering algorithms are presented and compared: max-cut, min-cut and min-concentration. They select the minimal set of cores in multiple core trees that maximizes or minimizes a certain objective function while limiting the QoS degradation according to a certain parameter called clustering ratio. These core selection algorithms are used to show the advantages of using several cores per group over the classical method of using only one

Abstract:In this paper, we propose a robust motion segmentation method using the techniques of matrix factorization and subspace separation. We first show that the shape interaction matrix can be derived using QR decomposition rather than singular value decomposition (SVD), which also leads to a simple proof of the shape subspace separation theorem. Using the shape interaction matrix, we solve the motion segmentation problems by the spectral clustering techniques. We exploit multi-way min-max cut clustering method and provide a novel approach for cluster membership assignment. We further show that we can combine a cluster refinement method based on subspace separation with the graph clustering method to improve its robustness in the presence of noise. The proposed method yields very good performance for both synthetic and real image sequences

Abstract:This paper introduces a new social metaheuristic for the max-cut problem applied to a weighted undirected graph. This problem consists in finding a partition of the nodes into two subsets, such that the sum of the weights of the edges having endpoints in different subsets is maximized. This NP-hard problem for non planar graphs has several application areas such as VLSI and ASICs CAD. The hierarchical social (HS) metaheuristic here proposed for solving the referred problem is tested and compared with other two metaheuristics: a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and an hybrid memetic heuristic that combines a genetic algorithm (GA) and a local search. The computational results on a set of standard test problems show the suitability of the approach

Abstract:The paper presents a general method of designing constant-factor approximation algorithms for some discrete optimization problems with assignment-type constraints. The core of the method is a simple deterministic procedure of rounding of linear relaxations (referred to as pipage rounding). With the help of the method we design approximation algorithms with better performance guarantees for some well-known problems including MAXIMUM COVERAGE, MAX CUT with given sizes of parts and some of their generalizations.

Abstract:We present an improved semidefinite programming based approximation algorithm for the MAX CUT problem in graphs of maximum degree at most 3. The approximation ratio of the new algorithm is at least 0.9326. This improves, and also somewhat simplifies, a result of Feige, Karpinski and Langberg. We also observe that results of Hopkins and Staton and of Bondy and Locke yield a simple combinatorial 4/5-approximation algorithm for the problem. Finally, we present a combinatorial 22/27-approximation algorithm for the MAX CUT problem for regular cubic graphs. &copy; 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract:The contribution of this article is to describe a general technique to solve some classes of large but sparse semidefinite problems via a robust primal-dual interior-point technique, which uses an inexact Gauss-Newton approach with a matrix free preconditioned conjugate gradient method. This approach avoids the ill-conditioning pitfalls that result from symmetrization and from forming the so-called normal equations, while maintaining the primal-dual framework. First, we apply a preprocessing step that reduces the optimality conditions before linearization and results in a single, well-conditioned, overdetermined bilinear operator equation. We then use preconditioned conjugate-gradients to approximately solve the linearization at every step of a path-following approach. We do not form the matrix representation of the linearization. In addition, once close to the optimal solution, we apply a crossover technique after which the iterates are no longer forced to be positive definite. In the experimental part of this article, we use Max-Cut to illustrate the technique. We describe preconditioners that exploit the operator structure of the constraints and show how the crossover can be effective in practice and how it allows for warm starts. In all cases we obtain high-accuracy solutions.

Abstract:In this article, we propose a feasible direction algorithm for solving the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations of quadratic {-1, 1) programming problems. This algorithm's distinguishing features are that it uses a low rank factorization and searches with a constant step-size. Its convergence is also proven. Finally, we report some numerical examples to compare our method with the low rank factorization method of Burer and Monteiro on the SDP relaxation of the max-cut problem.

Abstract:We introduce a new class of valid inequalities for general integer linear programs, called binary clutter (BC) inequalities. They include the {0, 1/2 }-cuts of Caprara and Fischetti as a special case and have some interesting connections to binary matroids, binary clutters and Gomory corner polyhedra. We show that the separation problem for BC-cuts is strongly NP-hard in general, but polynomially solvable in certain special cases. As a by-product we also obtain new conditions under which {0, 1/2 }-cuts can be separated in polynomial time. These ideas are then illustrated using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as an example. This leads to an interesting link between the TSP and two apparently unrelated problems, the T-join and max-cut problems. &copy; 2003 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract:We consider linear programming relaxations for the max cut problem in graphs, based on k-gonal inequalities. We show that the integrality ratio for random dense graphs is asymptotically 1 + 1/4 and for random sparse graphs is at least 1 + 3/k. There are O(n<sup>k</sup>) k-gonal inequalities. These results generalize work by Poljak and Tuza, who gave similar results for k = 3.

Abstract:Hypermetric inequalities have many applications, most recently in the approximate solution of max-cut problems by linear and semidefinite programming. However, not much is known about the separation problem for these inequalities. Previously Avis and Grishukhin showed that certain special cases of the separation problem for hypermetric inequalities are NP-hard, as evidence that the separation problem is itself hard. We show that similar results hold for inequalities of negative type, even though the separation problem for negative type inequalities is well known to be solvable in polynomial time. We also show similar results hold for the more general k-gonal and gap inequalities

Abstract:Finding a stable state of a neural network with optimal harmony (or energy) is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we give an approximation algorithm that finds a stable state that is within 87% of optimal. Optimality is measured with respect to a notion of "scaled" harmony, which we define in this paper to be the harmony in the traditional sense plus the sum of the absolute values of all the weights in the network. To achieve this approximation result, we build upon the work of Thagard and Verbeurgt (1998) for approximation of the coherence problem. This work was motivated by the work of Goemans and Williamson (1994) in approximation of the Max Cut problem

Abstract:The maximum 2-satisfiability problem (MAX-2-SAT) is: given a Boolean formula in 2-CNF, find a truth assignment that satisfies the maximum possible number of its clauses. MAX-2-SAT is MAX-SNP-complete. Recently, this problem received much attention in the contexts of (polynomial-time) approximation algorithms and (exponential-time) exact algorithms. We present an exact algorithm solving MAX-2-SAT in time poly(L)&middot;2<sup>k/5</sup>, where K is the number of clauses and L is their total length. In fact, the running time is only poly(L)&middot;2<sup>k</sup><sub>2</sub>/5, where K<sub>2</sub> is the number of clauses containing two literals. This bound implies the bound poly(L)&middot;2<sup>L/10</sup>. Our results significantly improve previous bounds: poly(L)&middot;2<sup>k/2.88</sup> (J. Algorithms 36 (2000) 62-88) and poly(L)&middot;2<sup>k/3.44</sup> (implicit in Bansal and Raman (Proceedings of the 10th Annual Conference on Algorithms and Computation, ISAAC'99, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 1741, Springer, Berlin, 1999, pp. 247-258.)). As an application, we derive upper bounds for the (MAX-SNP-complete) maximum cut problem (MAX-CUT), showing that it can be solved in time poly(M)&middot;2<sup>M/3</sup>, where M is the number of edges in the graph. This is of special interest for graphs with low vertex degree

Abstract:We use the notion of domination ratio introduced by Glover and Punnen in 1997 to present a new classification of combinatorial optimization (CO) problems: DOM-easy and DOM-hard problems. It follows from results already proved in the 1970s that min TSP (both symmetric and asymmetric versions) is DOM-easy. We prove that several CO problems are DOM-easy including weighted max k-SAT and max cut. We show that some other problems, such as max clique and min vertex cover, are DOM-hard unless P=NP

Abstract:We propose a new relaxation scheme for the MAX-CUT problem using second-order cone programming. We construct relaxation problems to reflect the structure of the original graph. Numerical experiments show that our relaxation gives better bounds than those based on the spectral decomposition proposed by Kim and Kojima, and that the efficiency of the branch-and-bound method using our relaxation is comparable to that using semidefinite relaxation in some cases

Abstract:In this paper, we present a weighted graph based method to simultaneously compare the textual content of two or more documents and extract the shared (sub)topics of them, if available. A set of documents are modelled with a set of pairwise weighted bipartite graphs. A generalized mutual reinforcement principle is applied to the pairwise bipartite graphs to calculate the saliency scores of sentences in each documents based on pairwise weighted bipartite graphs. Sentences with advantaged saliency are selected, and they together convey the dominant shared topic. If there are more than one shared subtopics among the documents, a spectral min-max cut algorithm can be used to partition a derived sentence similarity graph into several subgraphs. For a subgraph, if all documents contribute some sentences(nodes) to it, then these sentences(nodes) in the subgraph may convey a shared subtopic. The generalized mutual reinforcement principle is applied to them to verify and extract the shared subtopic.

Abstract:Many significant advances have been made in recent years for solving unconstrained binary quadratic programs. As a result, the size of problem instances that can be efficiently solved has grown from a hundred or so variables a few years ago to 2000 or 3000 variables today. These advances have motivated new applications of the model which, in turn, have created the need to solve even larger problems. In response to this need, we introduce several new "one pass" heuristics for solving very large versions of this problem. Our computational experience on problems of up to 9000 variables indicates that these methods are both efficient and effective for very large problems. The significance of problems of this size is that they not only open the door to solving a much wider array of real world problems, but also that the standard linear mixed integer formulations of the nonlinear models involve over 40,000,000 variables and three times that many constraints. Our approaches can be used as stand-alone solution methods, or they can serve as procedures for quickly generating high quality starting points for other, more sophisticated methods

Abstract:We obtain improved semidefinite programming based approximation algorithms for all the natural maximum bisection problems of graphs. Among the problems considered are: MAX n/2-BISECTION - partition the vertices of the graph into two sets of equal size such that the total weight of edges connecting vertices from different sides is maximized; MAX n/2-VERTEX-COVER - find a set containing half of the vertices such that the total weight of edges touching this set is maximized; MAXn/2-DENSE-SUBGRAPH - find a set containing half of the vertices such that the total weight of edges connecting two vertices from this set is maximized; and MAX n/2-UNCUT - partition the vertices into two sets of equal size such that the total weight of edges that do not cross the cut is maximized. We also consider the directed versions of these problems, such as MAX n/2-DIRECTED-BISECTION and MAX n/2-DIRECTED-UNCUT. These results can be used to obtain improved approximation algorithms for the unbalanced versions of the partition problems mentioned above, where we want to partition the graph into two sets of size k and n-k, where k is not necessarily. Our results improve, extend and unify previous results

Abstract:Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations are proving to be a powerful tool for finding tight bounds for hard discrete optimization problems. This is especially true for one of the easier NP-hard problems, the Max-Cut problem (MC). The well-known SDP relaxation for Max-Cut, here denoted SDP1, can be derived by a first lifting into matrix space and has been shown to be excellent both in theory and in practice. Recently the present authors have derived a new relaxation using a second lifting. This new relaxation, denoted SDP2, is strictly tighter than the relaxation obtained by adding all the triangle inequalities to the well-known relaxation. In this paper we present new results that further describe the remarkable tightness of this new relaxation. Let &Fscr;<sub>n</sub> denote the feasible set of SDP2 for the complete graph with n nodes, let F<sub>n</sub> denote the appropriately defined projection of &Fscr;<sub>n</sub>, into &Sscr;<sup>n</sup> the space of real symmetric n &times; n matrices, and let C<sub>n</sub> denote the cut polytope in &Sscr;<sup>n</sup>. Further let Y &isin; &Fscr;<sub>n</sub> be the matrix variable of the SDP2 relaxation and X &isin; F<sub>n</sub> be its projection. Then for the complete graph on 3 nodes, F<sub>3</sub> = C<sub>3</sub> holds. We prove that the rank of the matrix variable Y &isin; &Fscr;<sub>3</sub> of SDP2 completely characterizes the dimension of the face of the cut polytope in which the corresponding matrix X lies. This shows explicitly the connection between the rank of the variable Y of the second lifting and the possible locations of the projected matrix X within C<sub>3</sub>. The results we prove for n = 3 cast further light on how SDP2 captures all the structure of C<sub>3</sub> and furthermore they are stepping stones for studying the general case n &ges; 4. For this case, we show that the characterization of the vertices of the cut polytope via rank Y = 1 extends to all n &ges; 4. More interestingly, we show that the characterization of the one-dimensional faces via rank Y = 2 also holds for n &ges; 4. Furthermore, we prove that if rank Y = 2 for n &ges; 3, then a simple algorithm exhibits the two rank-one matrices (corresponding to cuts) which are the vertices of the one-dimensional face of the cut polytope where X lies

Abstract:MAX CUT is the problem of partitioning the vertices of a graph into two sets, maximizing the number of edges joining these sets. This problem is NP-hard. M. Goemans and D. Williamson (1995) proposed an algorithm that first uses a semidefinite programming relaxation of MAX CUT to embed the vertices of the graph on the surface of an n-dimensional sphere, and then uses a random hyperplane to cut the sphere in two, giving a cut of the graph. They show that the expected number of edges in the random cut is at least &alpha;&middot;sdp, where &alpha;=0.87856 and sdp is the value of the semidefinite program, which is an upper bound on opt, the number of edges in the maximum cut. This manuscript shows the following results: (1) The integrality ratio of the semidefinite program is a. The previously known bound on the integrality ratio was roughly 0.8845. (2) In the presence of the so-called "triangle constraints," the integrality ratio is no better than roughly 0.891. The previously known bound was above 0.95. (3) There are graphs and optimal embeddings for which the best hyperplane approximates opt within a ratio no better than a, even in the presence of additional valid constraints. This strengthens a result of H. Karloff (1999) that applied only to the expected number of edges cut by a random hyperplane

Abstract:In this paper, a greedy heuristic and two local search algorithms, I-opt local search and k-opt local search, are proposed for the unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem (BQP). These heuristics are well suited for the incorporation into meta-heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms. Their performance is compared for 115 problem instances. All methods are capable of producing high quality solutions in short time. In particular, the greedy heuristic is able to find near optimum solutions a few percent below the best-known solutions, and the local search procedures are sufficient to find the best-known solutions of all problem instances with n &les; 100. The k-opt local searches even find the best-known solutions for all problems of size n &les; 250 and for 11 out of 15 instances of size it = 500 in all runs. For larger problems (n = 500, 1000, 2500), the heuristics appear to be capable of finding near optimum solutions quickly. Therefore, the proposed heuristics, especially the k-opt local search, offer a great potential for the incorporation in more sophisticated meta-heuristics

Abstract:In this paper we study two strengthened semidefinite programming relaxations for the Max-Cut problem. Our results hold for every instance of Max-Cut; in particular, we make no assumptions about the edge weights. We prove that the first relaxation provides a strengthening of the Goemans-Williamson relaxation. The second relaxation is a further tightening of the first one and we prove that its feasible set corresponds to a convex set that is larger than the cut polytope but nonetheless is strictly contained in the intersection of the elliptope and the metric polytope. Both relaxations are obtained using Lagrangian relaxation. Hence, our results also exemplify the strength and flexibility of Lagrangian relaxation for obtaining a variety of SDP relaxations with different properties. We also address some practical issues in the solution of these SDP relaxations. Because Slater's constraint qualification fails for both of them, we project their feasible sets onto a lower dimensional space in a way that does not affect the sparsity of these relaxations but guarantees Slater's condition. Some preliminary numerical results are included

Abstract:Improving and extending recent results of Matuura and Matsui, and less recent results of Feige and Goemans, we obtain improved approximation algorithms for the MAX 2-SAT and MAX DI-CUT problems. These approximation algorithms start by solving semidefinite programming relaxations of these problems. They then rotate the solution obtained, as suggested by Feige and Goemans. Finally, they round the rotated vectors using random hyperplanes chosen according to skewed distributions. The performance ratio obtained by the MAX 2-SAT algorithm is at least 0.940, while that obtained by the MAX DI-CUT algorithm is at least 0.874. We show that these are essentially the best performance ratios that can be achieved using any combination of prerounding rotations and skewed distributions of hyperplanes, and even using more general families of rounding procedures. The performance ratio obtained for the MAX 2-SAT problem is fairly close to the inapproximability bound of about 0.954 obtained by Ha&ring;stad. The performance ratio obtained for the MAX DI-CUT problem is very close to the performance ratio of about 0.878 obtained by Goemans and Williamson for the MAX CUT problem. &copy; 2002 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract:Semidefinite programming (SDP) is currently one of the most active areas of research in optimization. SDP has attracted researchers from a wide variety of areas because of its theoretical and numerical elegance as well as its wide applicability. In this paper we present a survey of two major areas of application for SDP, namely discrete optimization and matrix completion problems. In the first part of this paper we present a recipe for finding SDP relaxations based on adding redundant constraints and using Lagrangian relaxation. We illustrate this with several examples. We first show that many relaxations for the max-cut problem (MC) are equivalent to both the Lagrangian and the well-known SDP relaxation. We then apply the recipe to obtain new strengthened SDP relaxations for MC as well as known SDP relaxations for several other hard discrete optimization problems. In the second part of this paper we discuss two completion problems, the positive semidefinite matrix completion problem and the Euclidean distance matrix completion problem. We present some theoretical results on the existence of such completions and then proceed to the application of SDP to find approximate completions. We conclude this paper with a new application of SDP to find approximate matrix completions for large and sparse instances of Euclidean distance matrices. &copy; 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract:Mincut partitioning aims to minimize the total cuts of edges by partitioning nodes into two sets. Two-way mincut partitioning is NP-complete. Previous methods only use node information and can only yield heuristic solutions. The paper proposes energy level diagram model and indicate that the minimum cut plane characteristics significantly affects the circuit partitioning problems. Under a similar cut plane position, if a circuit has fewer cut on the plane, and means the higher flows pass the edge, we have higher probability to hit the mincut. If the "normal vector" of the minimum cut plane is identical with the front-end to back-end direction, we also have higher probability to hit the mincut. And the work also finds that regard the sequential circuit or other time-sensitive circuits as an indivisible element, record the level is even or odd, and record the level number of every node or edge, are useful for modern circuit partitioning. &copy; 2002 IEEE.

Abstract:Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) with |V| = n and an integer k between 0 and n, the maximization graph partition (MAX-GP) problem is to determine a subset S &sub; V of k nodes such that an objective function &omega;(S) is maximized. The MAX-GP problem can be formulated as a binary quadratic program and it is NP-hard. Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations of such quadratic programs have been used to design approximation algorithms with guaranteed performance ratios for various MAX-GP problems. Based on several earlier results, we present an improved rounding method using an SDP relaxation, and establish improved approximation ratios for several MAX-GP problems, including Dense-Subgraph, Max-Cut, Max-Not-Cut, and Max-Vertex-Cover.

Abstract:Semidefinite programming based approximation algorithms, such as the Goemans and Williamson approximation algorithm for the MAX CUT problem, are usually shown to have certain performance guarantees using local ratio techniques. Are the bounds obtained in this way tight? This problem was considered before by Karloff [SIAM J. Comput., 29 (1999), pp. 336-350] and by Alon and Sudakov [Combin. Probab. Comput., 9 (2000), pp. 1-12]. Here we further extend their results and show, for the first time, that the local analyses of the Goemans and Williamson MAX CUT algorithm, as well as its extension by Zwick, are tight for every possible relative size of the maximum cut in the sense that the expected value of the solutions obtained by the algorithms may be as small as the analyses ensure. We also obtain similar results for a related problem. Our approach is quite general and could possibly be applied to some additional problems and algorithms.

Abstract:Optimized solvers for the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem have many applications in areas such as hardware and software verification, FPGA routing, planning, etc. Further uses are complicated by the need to express "counting constraints" in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Expressing such constraints by pure CNF leads to more complex SAT instances. Alternatively, those constraints can be handled by Integer Linear Programming (ILP), but generic ILP solvers may ignore the Boolean nature of 0-1 variables. Therefore specialized 0-1 ILP solvers extend SAT solvers to handle these so-called "pseudo-Boolean" constraints. This work provides an update on the on-going competition between generic ILP techniques and specialized 0-1 ILP techniques. To make a fair comparison, we generalize recent ideas for fast SAT-solving to more general 0-1 ILP problems that may include counting constraints and optimization. Another aspect of our comparison is evaluation on 0-1 ILP benchmarks that originate in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), but that cannot be directly solved by a SAT solver. Specifically, we solve instances of the Max-SAT and Max-ONEs optimization problems which seek to maximize the number of satisfied clauses and the "true" values over all satisfying assignments, respectively. Those problems have straightforward applications to SAT-based routing and are additionally important due to reductions from Max-Cut, Max-Clique, and Min Vertex Cover. Our experimental results show that specialized 0-1 techniques tend to outperform generic ILP techniques on Boolean optimization problems as well as on general EDA SAT problems

Abstract:We study enumeration problems for polytopes arising from combinatorial optimization problems. While these polytopes turn out to be quickly intractable for enumeration algorithms designed for general polytopes, tailor-made algorithms using their rich combinatorial features can exhibit strong performances. The main engine of these combinatorial algorithms is the use of the large symmetry group of combinatorial polytopes. Specifically we consider a polytope with applications to the well-known max-cut and multicommodity flow problems: the metric polytope m<sub>n</sub> on n nodes. We prove that for n&ges;9 the faces of codimension 3 of the metric polytope are partitioned into 15 orbits of its symmetry group. For n&les;8, we describe additional upper layers of the face lattice of m<sub>n</sub>. In particular, using the list of orbits of high dimensional faces of m<sub>8</sub>, we prove that the description of m<sub>8</sub> given by Deza et al. (2001) is complete with 1,550,825,000 vertices and that the Laurent-Powak conjecture (1992) holds for n&lt;8. Many vertices of m<sub>9</sub> are computed and additional results on the structure of the metric polytope are presented. Computational issues for the orbitwise face and vertex enumeration algorithms are also discussed

Abstract:Maximum cut is an important example of a class of combinatorial optimization problems. It has many important applications including the design of VLSI circuits and design of communication networks. The goal of this NP-complete problem is to partition the node set of an undirected graph into two parts in order to maximize the cardinality of the set of edges cut by the partition. In this paper, we propose a parallel algorithm using gradient ascent learning algorithm of the Hopfield neural networks for efficiently solving such optimization problems. The proposed learning algorithm is tested on a 2-variable quadratic polynomial and applied to the MAX CUT problem. Extensive simulations are performed and its effectiveness is confirmed

Abstract:Let &alpha; &sime; 0.87856 denote the best approximation ratio currently known for the Max-Cut problem on general graphs. We consider a semidefinite relaxation of the Max-Cut problem, round it using the random hyperplane rounding technique of Goemans and Williamson [J. ACM 42 (1995) 1115-1145], and then add a local improvement step. We show that for graphs of degree at most &delta;, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of at least &alpha; + &Epsilon;, where &Epsilon; &gt; 0 is a constant that depends only on &Delta;. Using computer assisted analysis, we show that for graphs of maximal degree 3 our algorithm obtains an approximation ratio of at least 0.921, and for 3-regular graphs the approximation ratio is at least 0.924. We note that for the semidefinite relaxation of Max-Cut used by Goemans and Williamson the integrality gap is at least 1/0.885, even for 2-regular graphs.

Abstract:Given an undirected graph with edge weights, the MAX-CUT problem consists in finding a partition of the nodes into two subsets, such that the sum of the weights of the edges having endpoints in different subsets is maximized. It is a well-known NP-hard problem with applications in several fields, including VLSI design and statistical physics. In this article, a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP), a variable neighborhood search (VNS), and a path-relinking (PR) intensification heuristic for MAX-CUT are proposed and tested. New hybrid heuristics that combine GRASP, VNS, and PR are also proposed and tested. Computational results indicate that these randomized heuristics find near-optimal solutions. On a set of standard test problems, new best known solutions were produced for many of the instances.

Abstract:In symbolic model checking, image computation is the process of computing the successors of a set of states. Containing the cost of image computation depends critically on controlling the number of variables that appear in the functions being manipulated; this in turn depends on the order in which the basic operations of image computation-conjunctions and quantifications-are performed. In this paper we propose an approach to this ordering problem-the conjunction scheduling problem-that is especially suited to the case in which the transition relation is specified as the composition of many small relations. (This is the norm in hardware verification.) Our fine-grain approach leads to the formulation of conjunction scheduling in terms of minimum max-cut linear arrangement, an NP-complete problem for which efficient heuristics have been developed. The cut whose width is minimized is related to the number of variables active during image computation. We also propose a clustering technique that is geared toward the minimization of the max-cut, and pruning techniques for the transition relation that benefit especially from the fine-grain approach

Abstract:We present a new efficient sampling method for approximating r-dimensional Maximum Constraint Satisfaction Problems, MAX-rCSP, on n variables up to an additive error &Epsilon;n<sup>r</sup>. We prove a new general paradigm in that it suffices, for a given set of constraints, to pick a small uniformly random subset of its variables, and the optimum value of the subsystem induced on these variables gives (after a direct normalization and with high probability) an approximation to the optimum of the whole system up to an additive error of &Epsilon;n<sup>r</sup>. Our method gives for the first time a polynomial in &Epsilon;<sup>-1</sup> bound on the sample size necessary to carry out the above approximation. Moreover, this bound is independent in the exponent on the dimension r. The above method gives a completely uniform sampling technique for all the MAX-rCSP problems, and improves the best known sample bounds for the low dimensional problems, like MAX-CUT. The method of solution depends on a new result on the cut norm of random subarrays, and a new sampling technique for high dimensional linear programs. This method could be also of independent interest.

Abstract:In this paper, we present a projected gradient algorithm for solving the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the maximum cut (maxcut) problem. Coupled with a randomized method, this gives a very efficient approximation algorithm for the maxcut problem. We report computational results comparing our method with two earlier successful methods on problems with dimension up to 7,000.

Abstract:We approach the class discovery and leaf ordering problems using spectral graph partitioning methodologies. For class discovery or clustering, we present a min-max cut hierarchical clustering method and show it produces subtypes quite close to human expert labeling on the lymphoma dataset with 6 classes. On optimal leaf ordering for displaying the gene expression data, we present a sequential ordering method that can be computed in O(n<sup>2</sup>) time which also preserves the cluster structure. We also show that the well known statistic methods such as F-statistic test and the principal component analysis are very useful in gene expression analysis.

Abstract:The inflation G<sub>I</sub> of a graph G is obtained from G by replacing each vertex x of degree d(x) by a clique X [asymptotically equal to] K<sub>d(x)</sub> and each edge xy by an edge between two vertices of the corresponding cliques X and Y of G<sub>I</sub> in such a way that the edges of G<sub>I</sub> which come from the edges of G form a matching of G<sub>I</sub>. Some properties related to the parameters of independence, domination and irredundance of an inflation G<sub>I</sub> have already been studied in Dunbar and Haynes (Congr. Numer. 118 (1996) 143), Favaron (J. Graph Theory 28 (2) (1998) 97) and Puech (J. Combin. Math. Combin. Comput. 33 (2000) 117-127). We prove here that if we denote by &beta; and IR the independence number and the upper irredundance number of a graph, the 2-connected graphs G satisfying &beta;(G<sub>I</sub>) = IR(G<sub>I</sub>) are those ones for which maxcut(G) is at most the order of G (these graphs have been determined in Delorme and Favaron (Utilitas Math. 56 (1999) 153)). &copy; 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract:The Max-Cut problem is the problem of finding a bipartition of an undirected connected loopless graph with edge weights, such that the sum of the weights of the edges connecting a node in V<sub>1</sub> with a node in V<sub>-1</sub> is maximized. It is an NP hard problem, so a great endeavour to find a good heuristics goes on. The matrix-based rank-two continuous optimization relaxation of Burer, Monteiro and Zhang (2000) doesn't increase the number of variables, and eliminates the constraints at the same time. The relaxed continuous solution can be easily "rounded" to produce an approximate Goemans-Williamson-type cut as well. It is the fastest known algorithm, however the gradient method that it utilizes can be further improved by noting special structure of the Hessian matrix. The bottle-neck remains perturbation in restarting

Abstract:The b-clique polytope CP<sub>b</sub><sup>n</sup> is the convex hull of the node and edge incidence vectors of all subcliques of size at most b of a complete graph on n nodes. Including the Boolean quadric polytope QP<sup>n</sup>=: CP<sub>n</sub><sup>n</sup> as a special case and being closely related to the quadratic knapsack polytope, it has received considerable attention in the literature. In particular, the max-cut problem is equivalent with optimizing a linear function over CP<sub>n</sub><sup>n</sup>. The problem of optimizing linear functions over CP<sub>b</sub><sup>n</sup> has so far been approached via heuristic combinatorial algorithms and cutting-plane methods. We study the structure of CP<sub>b</sub><sup>n</sup> in further detail and present a new computational approach to the linear optimization problem based on the idea of integrating cutting planes into a Lagrangian relaxation of an integer programming problem, as suggested by Balas and Christofides (1981) for the travelling salesman problem. In particular, we show that the separation problem for tree inequalities becomes polynomial in our Lagrangian framework. Finally, computational results are presented

Abstract:Given a graph G = (V, E), a weight function w: E &rarr; R<sup>+</sup>, and a parameter k, we consider the problem of finding a subset U &sube; V of size k that maximizes: Max-Vertex Cover<sub>k</sub> the weight of edges incident with vertices in U, Max-Dense Subgraph<sub>k</sub> the weight of edges in the subgraph induced by U, Max-Cut<sub>k</sub> the weight of edges cut by the partition (U,V\U), Max-Uncut<sub>k</sub> the weight of edges not cut by the partition (U,V\U). For each of the above problems we present approximation algorithms based on semidefinite programming and obtain approximation ratios better than those previously published. In particular we show that if a graph has a vertex cover of size k, then one can select in polynomial time a set of k vertices that covers over 80% of the edges

Abstract:An important application of graph partitioning is data clustering using a graph model - the pairwise similarities between all data objects form a weighted graph adjacency matrix that contains all necessary information for clustering. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for graph partitioning with an objective function that follows the min-max clustering principle. The relaxed version of the optimization of the min-max cut objective function leads to the Fiedler vector in spectral graph partitioning. Theoretical analyses of min-max cut indicate that it leads to balanced partitions, and lower bounds are derived. The min-max cut algorithm is tested on newsgroup data sets and is found to out-perform other current popular partitioning/clustering methods. The linkage-based refinements to the algorithm further improve the quality of clustering substantially. We also demonstrate that a linearized search order based on linkage differential is better than that based on the Fiedler vector, providing another effective partitioning method

Abstract:In this paper, we find the relationship between mincut circuit partitioning and the initial (V, E) pairs distributed condition/entropy on the V-E plain. If a circuit has higher initial potential/entropy, under a nearly max-cut reservation, we have a higher probability to aim the mincut. The proposed new method is called Interleaved Cutting-Edge-Node Interleaved Sort for Leaching and Envelop (IC-ENISLE) algorithm. It not only uses node and edge information, but also uses the max-min dual property. This new method is simple, but works effectively. Hundreds of netlist experiments have ever been processed. It shows that we can soon get an intuitive heuristic nearly optimal solution for the mincut and the ratio mincut partitioning at the same time. Also the method can display every process step by data compression techniques, is very suitable for IC CAD industrial usage

Abstract:Approximation algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems have been widely studied for over three decades. Most of these measure the quality of the solution produced by taking the ratio of the cost of the solution produced by the algorithm to the cost of an optimal solution. In certain cases, this ratio may not be very meaningful-for example, if the ratio of the worst solution to the best solution is at most some constant &alpha;, then an approximation algorithm with factor a may in fact yield the worst solution! To overcome this hurdle (among others), several authors have independently suggested the use of a different measure which we call z-approximation. An algorithm is an &alpha; z-approximation if it runs in polynomial time and produces a solution whose distance from the optimal one is at most a times the distance between the optimal solution and the worst possible solution. The results known so far about z-approximations are either of the inapproximability type or rather straightforward observations. We design polynomial time algorithms for several fundamental discrete optimization problems; in particular we obtain a z-approximation factor of &frac12; for the directed traveling salesman problem (TSP) 2 (with no triangle inequality assumption). For the undirected TSP this improves to We also show that if there is a polynomial time algorithm that for any fixed &epsi; &gt; 0 yields an &epsi; z-approximation then P = NP. We also present z-approximations for several other problems such as max cut, stacker crane, maximum acyclic subgraph, and minimum disjoint cycle cover

Abstract:The unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem (BQP) is known to be NP-hard and has many practical applications. The paper presents a simulated annealing (SA)-based heuristic for the BQP. The new SA heuristic for the BQP is based on a simple (1-opt) local search heuristic and designed with a simple cooling schedule, but multiple annealing processes are adopted. To show practical performances of the SA, we test on publicly available benchmark instances of large size ranging from 500 to 2500 variables and compare them with other heuristics such as multi-start local search, the previous SA, tabu search, and genetic algorithm incorporating the 1-opt local search. Computational results indicate that our SA leads to high-quality solutions with short times and is more effective than the competitors particularly for the largest benchmark set. Furthermore, the values of new best-known solutions found by the SA for several large instances are also reported

Abstract:We investigate the approximability properties of several weighted problems, by comparing them with the respective unweighted problems. For an appropriate (and very general) definition of niceness, we show chat if a nice weighted problem is hard to approximate within r, then its polynomially bounded weighted version is hard to approximate within r-o(1). Then we turn our attention to specific problems, and we show that the unweighted versions of MIN VERTEX COVER, MIN SAT, MAX CUT, MAX DICUT, MAX 2SAT, and MAX EXACT kSAT are exactly as hard to approximate as their weighted versions. We note in passing that MIN VERTEX COVER is exactly as hard to approximate as MIN SAT. In order to prove the reductions for MAX 2SAT, MAX CUT, MAX DICUT, and MAX E3SAT we introduce the new notion of &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; set and we give an explicit construction of such sets. These reductions give new non-approximability results for these problems

Abstract:It is shown that for essentially all max SNP-hard optimization problems finding exact solutions in subexponential time is not possible unless W[1]=FPT. In particular, we show that O(2&deg;<sup>(k)</sup>p(n)) parameterized algorithms do not exist for vertex cover, max cut, max c-SAT, and a number of problems on bounded degree graphs such as dominating set and independent set, unless W[1]=FPT. Our results are derived via an approach that uses an extended parameterization of optimization problems and associated techniques to relate the parameterized complexity of problems in FPT to the parameterized complexity of extended versions that are W[1]-hard

Abstract:Two new strategies for automatic generation of invariants (such as Lyapunov functions and storage functions) of hybrid systems. are proposed. The first is based on combining elements of a prespecified set of partial invariants, which are defined as functions of system state which admit quadratic increment bounds subject to system dynamics. The complete invariant is then sought in the form of a convex combination of partial invariants. The second strategy relies on representation of system equations in the form of linear equalities imposed on analog and logical variables, and the invariant is sought in the form of a quadratic function of such variables. In both cases, the search for the actual system invariant reduces to minimization of a convex cost, where the cost function itself is defined in terms of a very specific non-convex optimization problem: maximization of a convex quadratic functional over a hypercube. This problem, which is a general version of the MAX-CUT problem, is known to be NP-hard but admits a family of suboptimal algorithms based on convex relaxations, which has shown promising results. A new logarithmic bound for the relaxation gap is derived for the standard relaxation algorithm in the MAX-CUT problem

Abstract:We consider the problem of scheduling unrelated parallel machines subject to release dates so as to minimize the total weighted completion time of jobs. The main contribution of this paper is a provably good convex quadratic programming relaxation of strongly polynomial size for this problem. The best previously known approximation algorithms are based on LP relaxations in time- or interval-indexed variables. Those LP relaxations, however, suffer from a huge number of variables. As a result of the convex quadratic programming approach we can give a very simple and easy to analyze 2-approximation algorithm which can be further improved to performance guarantee 3/2 in the absence of release dates. We also consider preemptive scheduling problems and derive approximation algorithms and results on the power of preemption which improve upon the best previously known results for these settings. Finally, for the special case of two machines we introduce a more sophisticated semidefinite programming relaxation and apply the random hyperplane technique introduced by Goemans and Williamson for the MAXCUT problem; this leads to an improved 1.2752-approximation

Abstract:Analog computation is a processing method that solves a given problem by utilizing an analogy of a physical system to the problem. An idea is presented here for relating the behavior of quantum-flux parametron circuits to analog computation. As an example, a method is proposed for solving a combinatorial optimization problem, the max-cut problem, by utilizing the properties of quantum-flux parametron circuits. In problem solving, a parametron circuit is constructed whose free energy is related to the objective function of a given problem and then is made to settle down to its minimum energy state. The solution to the problem can be obtained by checking the final state that the circuit reaches. The effectiveness of this method was confirmed by computer simulation for sample problem instances

Abstract:Many combinatorial optimization problems have relaxations that are semidefinite programming problems. In principle, the combinatorial optimization problem can then be solved by using a branch-and-cut procedure, where the problems to be solved at the nodes of the tree are semidefinite programs. It is desirable that the solution to one node of the tree should be exploited at the child node in order to speed up the solution of the child. We show how the solution to the parent relaxation can be used as a warm start to construct an appropriate initial dual solution to the child problem. This restart method for SDP branch-and-cut can be regarded as analogous to the use of the dual simplex method in the branch-and-cut method for mixed integer linear programming problems

Abstract:Hypergraph 2-colorability, also known as set splitting, is a widely studied problem in graph theory. In this paper we study the maximization version of the same. We recast the problem as a special type of satisfiability problem and give approximation algorithms for it. Our results are valid for hypergraph 2-colorability, set splitting and MAX-CUT (which is a special case of hypergraph 2-colorability) because the reductions are approximation preserving. Here we study the MAXNAESP problem, the optimal solution to which is a truth assignment of the literals that maximizes the number of clauses satisfied. As a main result of the paper, we show that any locally optimal solution (a solution is locally optimal if its value cannot be increased by complementing assignments to literals and pairs of literals) is guaranteed a performance ratio of &frac12;+&epsiv;. This is an improvement over the ratio of &frac12; attributed to another local improvement heuristic for MAX-CUT (Papadimitriou, 1994). In fact we provide a bound of k/k+1 for this problem, where k&ges;3 is the minimum number of literals in a clause. Such locally optimal algorithms appear to subsume typical greedy algorithms that have been suggested for problems in the general domain of satisfiability. It should be noted that the NAESP problem where each clause has exactly two literals, is equivalent to MAX-CUT. However, obtaining good approximation ratios using semi-definite programming techniques (Goemans and Williamson, 1994) appears difficult. Also, the randomized rounding algorithm as well as the simple randomized algorithm both (Goemans and Williamson, 1994) yield a bound of 1 for the MAXNAESP problem. In contrast to this, the algorithm proposed in this paper obtains a bound of &frac12;+&epsiv; for this problem

Abstract:Several combinatorial optimization problems can be approximated using algorithms based on semidefinite programming. In many of these algorithms a semidefinite relaxation of the underlying problem is solved yielding an optimal vector configuration v1 ... vn. This vector configuration is then rounded into a f0; 1g solution. We present a procedure called RPR2 (Random Projection followed by Randomized Rounding) for rounding the solution of such semidefinite programs. We show that the random hyperplane rounding technique introduced by Goemans and Williamson, and its variant that involves outward rotation are both special cases of RPR2. We illustrate the use of RPR2 by presenting two applications. For Max-Bisection we improve the approximation ratio. For Max-Cut, we improve the tradeoff curve (presented by Zwick) that relates the approximation ratio to the size of the maximum cut in a graph. &copy; 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract:An important application of graph partitioning is data clustering using a graph model - the pairwise similarities between all data objects form a weighted graph adjacency matrix that contains all necessary information for clustering. Here we propose a new algorithm for graph partition with an objective function that follows the min-max clustering principle. The relaxed version of the optimization of the min-max cut objective function leads to the Fiedler vector in spectral graph partition. Theoretical analyses of min-max cut indicate that it leads to balanced partitions, and lower bonds are derived. The min-max cut algorithm is tested on news-group datasets and is found to outperform other current popular partitioning/clustering methods. The linkage-based refinements in the algorithm further improve the quality of clustering substantially. We also demonstrate that the linearized search order based on linkage differential is better than that based on the Fiedler vector, providing another effective partition method. &copy; 2001 IEEE.

Abstract:We consider the general nonlinear optimization problem in 0-1 variables and provide an explicit equivalent positive semidefinite program in 2<sup>n</sup> - 1 variables. The optimal values of both problems are identical. From every optimal solution of the former, one easily finds an optimal solution of the latter, and conversely, from every solution of the latter, one may construct an optimal solution of the former. For illustration, the equivalent positive semidefinite program is explicated for quadratic 0-1 programs and MAX-CUT in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>. For unconstrained 0-1 programs, a special representation in terms of a weighted sum of squares is provided

Abstract:Most current implementations of interior-point methods for semidefinite programming use a direct method to solve the Schur complement equation (SCE) M&Delta;y = h in computing the search direction. When the number of constraints is large, the problem of having insufficient memory to store M can be avoided if an iterative method is used instead. Numerical experiments have shown that the conjugate residual (CR) method typically takes a huge number of steps to generate a high accuracy solution. On the other hand, it is difficult to incorporate traditional preconditioners into the SCE, except for block diagonal preconditioners. We decompose the SCE into a 2 &times; 2 block system by decomposing &Delta;y (similarly for h) into two orthogonal components with one lying in a certain subspace that is determined from the structure of M. Numerical experiments on semidefinite programming problems arising from the Lovasz &thetas;-function of graphs and MAXCUT problems show that high accuracy solutions can be obtained with a moderate number of CR steps using the proposed equation

Abstract:We study optimization problems that may be expressed as "Boolean constraint satisfaction problems." An instance of a Boolean constraint satisfaction problem is given by m constraints applied to n Boolean variables. Different computational problems arise from constraint satisfaction problems depending on the nature of the "underlying" constraints as well as on the goal of the optimization task. Here we consider four possible goals: Max CSP (Min CSP) is the class of problems where the goal is to find an assignment maximizing the number of satisfied constraints (minimizing the number of unsatisfied constraints). Max Ones (Min Ones) is the class of optimization problems where the goal is to find an assignment satisfying all constraints with maximum (minimum) number of variables set to 1. Each class consists of infinitely many problems and a problem within a class is specified by a finite collection of finite Boolean functions that describe the possible constraints that may be used. Tight bounds on the approximability of every problem in Max CSP were obtained by Creignou [J. Comput. System Sci., 51 (1995), pp. 511-522]. In this work we determine tight bounds on the "approximability" (i.e., the ratio to within which each problem may be approximated in polynomial time) of every problem in Max Ones, Min CSP, and Min Ones. Combined with the result of Creignou, this completely classifies all optimization problems derived from Boolean constraint satisfaction. Our results capture a diverse collection of optimization problems such as MAX 3-SAT, Max Cut, Max Clique, Min Cut, Nearest Codeword, etc. Our results unify recent results on the (in-)approximability of these optimization problems and yield a compact presentation of most known results. Moreover, these results provide a formal basis to many statements on the behavior of natural optimization problems that have so far been observed only empirically.

Abstract:In the successful branch-and-cut approach to combinatorial optimization, linear inequalities are used as cutting planes within a branch-and-bound framework. Although researchers often prefer to use facet-inducing inequalities as cutting planes, good computational results have recently been obtained using disjunctive cuts, which are not guaranteed to be facet-inducing in general. A partial explanation for the success of the disjunctive cuts is given in this paper. It is shown that, for six important combinatorial optimization problems (the clique partitioning, max-cut, acyclic subdigraph, linear ordering, asymmetric travelling salesman and set covering problems), certain facet-inducing inequalities can be obtained by simple disjunctive techniques. New polynomial-time separation algorithms are obtained for these inequalities as a by-product. The disjunctive approach is then compared and contrasted with some other 'general-purpose' frameworks for generating cutting planes and some conclusions are made with respect to the potential and limitations of the disjunctive approach.

Abstract:MAX CUT is the problem of partitioning the vertices of a graph into two sets, maximizing the number of edges joining these sets. This problem is NP-hard. Goemans and Williamson proposed an algorithm that first uses a semidefinite programming relaxation of MAX CUT to embed the vertices of the graph on the surface of an n dimensional sphere, and then uses a random hyperplane to cut the sphere in two, giving a cut of the graph. They show that the expected number of edges in the random cut is at least &alpha; &middot sdp, where &alpha; &sime; 0.87856 and sdp is the value of the semidefinite program. This manuscript shows the following results: 1. The integrality ratio of the semidefinite program is &alpha;. The previously known bound on the integrality ratio was roughly 0.8845. 2. In the presence of the so called "triangle constraints", the integrality ratio is no better than roughly 0.891. The previously known bound was above 0.95.

Abstract:The b-clique polytope CP<inf>b</inf><sup>n</sup> is the convex hull of the node and edge incidence vectors of all subcliques of size at most b of a complete graph on n nodes. Including the Boolean quadric polytope QP<sup>n</sup> = CP<inf>n</inf><sup>n</sup> as a special case and being closely related to the quadratic knapsack polytope, it has received considerable attention in the literature. In particular, the max-cut problem is equivalent with optimizing a linear function over CP<inf>n</inf><sup>n</sup>. The problem of optimizing linear functions over CP<inf>b</inf><sup>n</sup> has so far been approached via heuristic combinatorial algorithms and cutting-plane methods. We study the structure of CP<inf>b</inf><sup>n</sup> in further detail and present a new computational approach to the linear optimization problem based on the idea of integrating cutting planes into a Lagrangian relaxation of an integer programming problem that Balas and Christofides had suggested for the traveling salesman problem. In particular, we show that the separation problem for tree inequalities becomes polynomial in our Lagrangian framework. Finally, computational results are presented.

Abstract:This paper considers generalized 2SAT problems, MAX GEN2SAT and MIN GEN2SAT. Instances of these problems are defined on a collection of `clauses', which we refer to as genclauses. A genclause is any boolean function on two variables, and each genclause has a non-negative weight associated with it in the problems that are considered. The objective of MAX GEN2SAT (MIN GEN2SAT) is to select a truth assignment that maximizes (minimizes) the total weight of satisfied genclauses. Goemans and Williamson used semidefinite programming and were able to provide substantial improvements in approximation factor guarantee for several important problems: MAX 2SAT, MAX CUT, MAX DICUT. In this paper we show how their approximation technique can be used to yield an approximation algorithm for MAX GEN2SAT, for which MAX 2SAT, MAX CUT, MAX DICUT are special cases. For MIN GEN2SAT, employing a recent technique of Hochbaum leads to easy recognition of which instances are polynomial or 2-approximable. The polynomial instances of MIN GEN2SAT have corresponding instances of MAX GEN2SAT which are thus identified as solvable in polynomial time. Among the applications of the approximation algorithms described it is shown that the forest harvesting problem has a 0.87856-approximation algorithm.

Abstract:We consider binary convex quadratic optimization problems, particularly those arising from reformulations of well-known combinatorial optimization problems such as MAX 2SAT (and MAX CUT). A bounding and approximation technique is developed. This technique subsumes the spherical relaxation, while it can also be considered as a restricted variant of the semidefinite relaxation. Its complexity however is comparable to that of the first. It is shown how the quality of the obtained approximate solution can be measured. We conclude with extensive computational results on the MAX 2SAT problem, which show that good-quality solutions are obtained.

Abstract:Quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QQPs) play an important modeling role for many diverse problems. These problems are in general NP hard and numerically intractable. Lagrangian relaxations often provide good approximate solutions to these hard problems. Such relaxations are equivalent to semidefinite programming relaxations. For several special cases of QQP, e.g., convex programs and trust region subproblems, the Lagrangian relaxation provides the exact optimal value, i.e., there is a zero duality gap. However, this is not true for the general QQP, or even the QQP with two convex constraints, but a nonconvex objective. In this paper we consider a certain QQP where the quadratic constraints correspond to the matrix orthogonality condition XX<sup>T</sup>=I. For this problem we show that the Lagrangian dual based on relaxing the constraints XX<sup>T</sup>=I and the seemingly redundant constraints X<sup>T</sup>X=I has a zero duality gap. This result has natural applications to quadratic assignment and graph partitioning problems, as well as the problem of minimizing the weighted sum of the largest eigenvalues of a matrix. We also show that the technique of relaxing quadratic matrix constraints can be used to obtain a strengthened semidefinite relaxation for the max-cut problem

Abstract:A class of multicommodity network flow with bounded lower and upper unbounded values of the flow is defined. This flow is called a multicommodity flow with inverse linear constraints (or multicommodity ILC-flow). The flow considered is an extension of the single-commodity ILC-flow. The capacity of the respective cutting sets is defined on the basis of the inverse linear constraints and a number of relations are proved, characterizing the multicommodity ILC-flow and the capacity of these cutting sets. It is proved that the minimal value of the multicommodity ILC-flow is equal to the capacity of the maximal cutting set (minflow-maxcut theorem). Some problems for the minimality and feasibility of the multicommodity ILC-flow are considered

Abstract:In this paper we introduce a new polynomial-time approximation scheme preserving reducibility, which we call PTAS-reducibility, that generalizes previous definitions. As a first application of this generalization, we prove the APX-completeness under PTAS-reducibility of a polynomially bounded optimization problem, that is, an APX problem whose measure function is bounded by a polynomial in the length of the instance and such that any APX problem is PTAS-reducible to it. As far as we know, no such problem was known before. This result combined with results of Khanna et al. allows us to infer that several natural optimization problems are APX-complete under PTAS-reducibility, such as MAX CUT and MAX SAT. Successively, we apply the notion of APX-completeness under PTAS-reducibility to the study of the relative complexity of evaluating an r-approximate value and computing an r-approximate solution for any r. We first show that if P&ne;NP&cap;coNP, then the former question can be easier than the latter even if the optimization problem is NP-hard. We then give strong evidence that if an optimization problem is APX-complete under PTAS-reducibility, then the two questions are both hard

Abstract:We present improved versions of the standard semi-definite relaxation for quadratic programming, that underlies many important results in robustness analysis and combinatorial optimization. It is shown that the proposed polynomial time convex conditions are at least as strong as the standard ones, and usually better, but at a higher computational cost. Several applications of the new relaxations are provided, including less conservative upper bounds for the structured singular value CL and enhanced solutions for the MAX CUT graph partitioning problem

Abstract:The s-t max-cut problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper an equivalent linearly constrained continuous optimization problem is formulated and an algorithm is proposed for approximating its solution. The algorithm is derived from an application of a logarithmic barrier function, where the barrier parameter behaves as temperature in an annealing procedure and decreases to zero from a sufficiently Large positive number satisfying that the barrier function is convex. The algorithm searches for a better solution in a feasible descent direction, which has a desired property that lower and upper bounds are always satisfied automatically if the step length is a number between zero and one. We prove that the algorithm converges to at least a local minimum point if a local minimum point of the barrier problem is generated for a sequence of descending values of the barrier parameter with zero limit. Numerical results show that the algorithm seems effective and efficient

Abstract:The complexity of the SIMPLE MAX CUT problem is investigated for several special classes of graphs. It is shown that this problem is NP-complete when restricted to one of the following classes: chordal graphs, undirected path graphs, split graphs, tripartite graphs, and graphs that are the complement of a bipartite graph. The problem can be solved in polynomial time when restricted to graphs with bounded treewidth, or cographs. We also give large classes of graphs that can be seen as generalizations of classes of graphs with bounded treewidth and of the class of cographs, and allow polynomial time algorithms for the SIMPLE MAX CUT problem

Abstract:We present a linear programming-based method for finding `gadgets,' i.e., combinatorial structures reducing constraints of one optimization problem to constraints of another. A key step in this method is a simple observation which limits the search space to a finite one. Using this new method we present a number of new, computer-constructed gadgets for several different reductions. This method also answers a question posed by Bellare, Goldreich, and Sudan of how to prove the optimality of gadgets: linear programming duality gives such proofs. The new gadgets, when combined with recent results of Hastad improve the known inapproximability results for MAX CUT and MAX DICUT, showing that approximating these problems to within factors of 16/17+&Epsilon; and 12/13+&Epsilon; respectively, is NP-hard for every &Epsilon;&gt;0. Prior to this work, the best-known inapproximability thresholds for both problems were 71/72. Without using the gadgets from this paper, the best possible hardness that would follow from Bellare, Goldreich, and Sudan and Hastad is 18/19. We also use the gadgets to obtain an improved approximation algorithm for MAX3 SAT which guarantees an approximation ratio of .801. This improves upon the previous best bound of .7704.

Abstract:In this paper we demonstrate a general method of designing constant-factor approximation algorithms for some discrete optimization problems with cardinality constraints. The core of the method is a simple deterministic (&ldquo;pipage&rdquo;) procedure of rounding of linear relaxations. By using the method we design a (1-(1-1/k)<sup>k</sup>)-approximation algorithm for the maximum coverage problem where k is the maximum size of the subsets that are covered, and a 1/2-approximation algorithm for the maximum cut problem with given sizes of parts in the vertex set bipartition. The performance guarantee of the former improves on that of the well-known (1-e<sup>-1</sup>)-greedy algorithm due to Cornuejols, Fisher and Nemhauser in each case of bounded k. The latter is, to the best of our knowledge, the first constant-factor algorithm for that version of the maximum cut problem

Using outward rotations, we obtain an approximation algorithm for MAX CUT that, in many interesting cases, performs better than the algorithm of Goemans and Williamson.

Finally, we provide some evidence that outward rotations can also be used to obtain improved approximation algorithms for MAX NAE-SAT and MAX SAT

Abstract:Remarkable breakthroughs have been made recently in obtaining approximate solutions to some fundamental NP-hard problems, namely Max-Cut, Max k-Cut, Max-Sat, Max-Dicut, Max-bisection, k-vortex coloring, maximum independent set, etc. All these breakthroughs involve polynomial time randomized algorithms based upon semidefinite programming, a technique pioneered by Goemans and Williamson. In this paper, we give techniques to derandomize the above class of randomized algorithms, thus obtaining polynomial time deterministic algorithms with the same approximation ratios for the above problems. At the heart of our technique is the use of spherical symmetry to convert a nested sequence of n integrations, which cannot be approximated sufficiently well in polynomial time, to a nested sequence of just a constant number of integrations, which can be approximated sufficiently well in polynomial time

Abstract:We deal with the maximum cut problem on cubic graphs and we present a simple O(log n)-time parallel algorithm, running on a CRCW PRAM with O(n) processors. The approximation ratio of our algorithm is 1.3, and this improves the best known parallel approximation ratio, i.e. 2, in the special case of cubic graphs

Abstract:In this paper we investigate the parameterized complexity of the problems MaxSat and MaxCut using the framework developed by R.G. Downey and M.R. Fellows (1997). Let G be an arbitrary graph having n vertices and m edges, and let f be an arbitrary CNF formula with m clauses on n variables. We improve Cai and Chen's O(2<sup>2ck</sup>cm) time algorithm for determining if at least k clauses of a c-CNF formula f can be satisfied; our algorithm runs in O(|f|+k<sup>2</sup>&phi;<sup>k</sup>) time for arbitrary formulae and in O(cm+ck&phi;<sup>k</sup>) time for c-CNF formulae, where &phi; is the golden ratio (1+&radic;5)/2. We also give an algorithm for finding a cut of size at least k our algorithm runs in O(m+n+k4<sup>k</sup>) time. We then argue that the standard parameterization of these problems is unsuitable, because nontrivial situations arise only for large parameter values (k&ges;[m/2]), in which range the fixed-parameter tractable algorithms are infeasible. A more meaningful question in the parameterized setting is to ask whether [m/2]+k clauses can be satisfied, or [m/2]+k edges can be placed in a cut. We show that these problems remain fixed-parameter tractable even under this parameterization. Furthermore, for up to logarithmic values of the parameter, our algorithms for these versions also run in polynomial time

Abstract:Genetic algorithms for the unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem (BQP) are presented. It is shown that for small problems, a simple genetic algorithm with uniform crossover is sufficient to find optimum or best-known solutions in a short time, while for problems with a high number of variables (n&ges;200), it is essential to incorporate local search to arrive at high quality solutions. A hybrid genetic algorithm incorporating local search is tested on 40 problem instances of sizes containing between n=200 and n=2500. The results of the computer experiments show that the approach is comparable to alternative heuristics such as tabu search for small instances and superior to tabu search and simulated annealing for large instances. New best solutions could be found for 14 large problem instances

Abstract:MAX CUT is the problem of partitioning the vertices of a graph into two sets, maximizing the number of edges joining these sets. Goemans and Williamson gave an algorithm that approximates MAX CUT within a ratio of 0.87856. Their algorithm first uses a semidefinite programming relaxation of MAX CUT that embeds the vertices of the graph on the surface of an n-dimensional sphere, and then cuts the sphere in two at random. We review several variations of this algorithm which offer improved approximation ratios for some special families of instances of MAX CUT, as well as for problems related to MAX CUT

Abstract:For pt.II see ibid., vol.32, p.716-29, 1999. Errors in the quantitative phase analysis (QPA) of &alpha;- and &beta;-silicon nitrides (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) using the mean normalized intensity (MNI) method and the Rietveld method have been estimated by theory and experiments. A total error for a weight fraction (w) in a binary system can be expressed in the form E(w)=w(1-w)S, where S is the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic errors. Random errors associated with counting statistics for integrated intensities in the MNI method are below 0.1~0.2 wt% if the studied reflections have average peak heights of more than ~1000 counts. Such errors will become approximately twice as large if peak-height intensities are used. The error associated with particle statistics in the studied samples was smaller than the counting-statistics error. Among various sources of systematic errors examined, incorrect choice of constrained/unconstrained full width at half-maximum (FWHM) parameters gave the largest error. The choice of the background function had little influence on the QPA, whereas the choice of the profile function had a large influence. Truncation errors in profile function calculations and the 2&thetas; range of the observed data are below &plusmn;0.1 wt% when appropriate criteria are applied. Systematic errors in the measurement of peak-height intensity arise primarily from the overestimation of intensities of weak peaks that overlap the tails of strong peaks, as well as from line broadening of &beta;-phase reflections in the studied samples. Errors caused by ignoring the difference in density between the two phases were negligibly small. Estimated errors of the methods followed the order: the MNI method using peak-height intensities&lt;the MNI method using integrated intensities&cong;the Rietveld method

Abstract:First, we describe the mathematical tools necessary to understand the method of semidefinite programming. Since algorithms for solving semidefinite programs are rather involved, we only give a sketch of the so-called interior-point method. We describe a &ldquo;classical&rdquo; approximation of MAXCUT, which is not based on semidefinite programming. We then show how Goemans and Williamson applied semidefinite programming to obtain better approximation algorithms for MAXCUT and analyze the quality of their algorithm. We describe the modeling of the asymmetric problems MAXDICUT and MAXE2SAT. A method for modeling long clauses in a semidefinite program is described. We review some classical approaches for MAXSAT and explain how different MAXSAT algorithms can be combined in order to improve the approximation ratio. The effect of additional constraints and of a nonuniform rounding technique is described

Abstract:Some years ago only very few optimization problems like KNAPSACK were known to have polynomial time approximation schemes. Since the PCP-Theorem implies that all APX-hard problems are unlikely to permit a PTAS, a consequent approach is to look for those subclasses which are easier to handle with respect to approximation. Baker (1994) shows that several NP-hard graph problems have a PTAS on planar graphs. Recently, research has been extended to the approximability of a large class of problems, including MAXCUT and MAXEkSAT, on dense instances. The topic of this paper is to survey the approximation results that have been achieved in this area

Abstract:We consider the problem of scheduling unrelated parallel machines so as to minimize the total weighted completion time of jobs. Whereas the best previously known approximation algorithms for this problem are based on LP relaxations, we give a 3/2-approximation algorithm that relies on a convex quadratic programming relaxation. For the special case of two machines we present a further improvement to a 1.2752-approximation; we introduce a more sophisticated semidefinite programming relaxation and apply the random hyperplane technique introduced by M.X. Goemans and D.P. Williamson (1995) for the MAXCUT problem and its refined version of U. Feige and M.X. Goemans (1995). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that convex and semidefinite programming techniques (apart from LPs) are used in the area of scheduling

Abstract:This paper continues the investigation of the connection between probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) and the approximability of NP-optimization problems. The emphasis is on proving tight nonapproximability results via consideration of measures such as the &ldquo;free-bit complexity&rdquo; and the &ldquo;amortized free-bit complexity&rdquo; of proof systems. The first part of the paper presents a collection of new proof systems based on a new error-correcting code called the long code. We provide a proof system that has amortized free-bit complexity of 2+&epsiv;, implying that approximating MaxClique within N(<sup>1/3</sup>-&epsiv;), and approximating the Chromatic Number within N(<sup>1/5</sup>-&epsiv;), are hard, assuming NP&ne;coRP, for any &epsiv;&gt;0. We also derive the first explicit and reasonable constant hardness factors for Min Vertex Cover, Max2SAT, and Max Cut, and we improve the hardness factor for Max3SAT. We note that our nonapproximability factors for MaxSNP problems are appreciably close to the values known to be achievable by polynomial time algorithms. Finally, we note a general approach to the derivation of strong nonapproximability results under which the problem reduces to the construction of certain &ldquo;gadgets&rdquo;. The increasing strength of nonapproximability results obtained via the PCP connection motivates us to ask how far this can go and whether PCPs are inherent in any way. The second part of the paper addresses this. The main result is a &ldquo;reversal&rdquo; of the connection due to Feige et al. (1996), where the latter had shown how to translate proof systems for NP into NP-hardness of approximation results for MaxClique, we show how any NP-hardness of approximation result for MaxClique yields a proof system for NP. Roughly our result says that for any constant f, if MaxClique is NP-hard to approximate within N<sup>1</sup>(1+f)/, then NP&sube;FPCP[log,f], the latter being the class of languages possessing proofs of logarithmic randomness and amortized free-bit complexity f. This suggests that PCPs are inherent to obtaining nonapproximability results. Furthermore, the tight relation suggests that reducing the amortized free-bit complexity is necessary for improving the nonapproximability results for MaxClique. The third part of our paper initiates a systematic investigation of the properties of PCP and FPCP (free PCP) as a function of the following various parameters: randomness, query complexity, free-bit complexity, amortized free-bit complexity, proof size, etc. We are particularly interested in &ldquo;triviality&rdquo; results, which indicate which classes are not powerful enough to capture NP. We also distil the role of randomized reductions in this area and provide a variety of useful transformations between proof checking complexity classes

Abstract:The max-cut problem is NP-hard and is one of the most interesting and studied problems in combinatorial optimisation. Under some conditions on the graph G or on the weight function, max-cut is polynomially solvable, e.g. when G is planar. A standard way to solve an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem exactly is to first formulate it as a mathematical programming problem and then to relax some of its constraints in order to solve it in polynomially time. The solution to the relaxed problem is finally used as a upper bound in an enumeration scheme like branch-and-bound or branch-and-cut. Depending on whether the variables of the mathematical programming problem describe the shores of a cut or its edges, we have the so called node formulation or the edge formulation, respectively. In the paper the max-cut problem is applied to the computation of the ground states of spin glasses

Along the line, we first propose a linear-time approximation algorithm on maxcut and two closely related problems: k-coloring and maximal k-color ordering problem. The k-coloring is a generalization of the maxcut and the maximal k-color ordering is a generalization of the k-coloring. For a graph G with e edges and n vertices, our maxcut approximation algorithm runs in O(e+n) sequential time yielding a nodebalanced maxcut with size at least (w(E)+w(E)/n)/2, improving the time complexity of O(e log e) known before. Building on the proposed maxcut technique and employing a height-balanced binary decomposition, we devise an O((e+n)log k) time algorithm for the k-coloring problem which always finds a k-partition of vertices such that the number of bad (or &ldquo;defected&rdquo;) edges does not exceed (w(E)/k)((n-1)/n)<sup>log k</sup>, thus improving both the time complexity O(enk) and the bound e/k known before. The other related problem is the maximal k-color ordering problem that has been an open problem. We show the problem is NP-complete, then present an approximation algorithm building on our k-coloring structure. A performance bound on maximal k-color ordering cost, 2kw(E)/3 is attained in O(ek) time. The solution quality of this algorithm is also tested experimentally and found to be effective

Abstract:We consider the problem of coloring k-colorable graphs with the fewest possible colors. We present a randomized polynomial time algorithm that colors a 3-colorable graph on n vertices with min {O(&Delta;<sup>1/3</sup> log<sup>1/2</sup> &Delta; log n), O(n<sup>1/4</sup> log<sup>1/2</sup> n)} colors where &Delta; is the maximum degree of any vertex. Besides giving the best known approximation ratio in terms of n, this marks the first nontrivial approximation result as a function of the maximum degree &Delta;. This result can be generalized to k-colorable graphs to obtain a coloring using min{O(&Delta;<sup>1-2</sup>k/ log<sup>1/2</sup> &Delta; log n), O(n<sup>1-3</sup>(k+1)/ log<sup>1/2</sup> n)} colors. Our results are inspired by the recent work of Goemans and Williamson who used an algorithm for semidefinite optimization problems, which generalize linear programs, to obtain improved approximations for the MAX CUT and MAX 2-SAT problems. An intriguing outcome of our work is a duality relationship established between the value of the optimum solution to our semidefinite program and the Lovasz &thetav;-function

Abstract:We prove upper and lower bounds on performance guarantees of approximation algorithms for the hierarchical MAX-SAT (H-MAX-SAT) problem. This problem is representative of a broad class of PSPACE-hard problems involving graphs, Boolean formulas, and other structures that are defined succinctly. Our first result is that, for some constant &epsiv;&lt;1, it is PSPACE-hard to approximate the function H-MAX-SAT to within ratio &epsiv;. We obtain our result using a reduction from the language recognition problem for a model of PSPACE called the probabilistically checkable debate system. As an immediate application, we obtain nonapproximability results for functions on hierarchical graphs by combining our result with previously known approximation-preserving reductions to other problems. For example, it is PSPACE-hard to approximate H-MAX-CUT and H-MAX-INDEPENDENT-SET to within some constant factor. Our second result is that there is an efficient approximation algorithm for H-MAX-SAT with performance guarantee 2/3. The previous best bound claimed for this problem was 1/2. One new technique of our algorithm can be used to obtain approximation algorithms for other problems, such as hierarchical MAX-CUT, which are simpler than previously known algorithms and which have performance guarantees that match the previous best bounds

Abstract:We survey well known problems from statistical mechanics involving optimal cuts of graphs. These problems include finding the ground states for the spin glass problem or for the random field Ising model, as well as finding the lowest energy barrier between the two ground states of a ferromagnet. The relations between the results in graph-theory and in physics are outlined. In particular, the solvability of a special max cut problem which arises in statistical mechanics is an easy consequence of a gauge invariance. Throughout the paper, we review some useful algorithms and results. We also give a simple solution of the cutwidth problem in the case of a regular tree

Abstract:This paper outlines an algorithm for optimum linear ordering (OLO) of a weighted parallel graph with O(n log k) worst-case time complexity, and O(n+k log(n/k) log k) expected-case time complexity, where n is the total number of nodes and k is the number of chains in the parallel graph. Next, the two-layer OLO problem is considered, where the goal is to place the nodes linearly in two routing layers minimizing the total wire length. The two-layer problem is shown to subsume the maxcut problem and a befitting heuristic algorithm is proposed. Experimental results on randomly generated samples show that the heuristic algorithm runs very fast and outputs optimum solutions in more than 90% instances

Abstract:An &ldquo;evolutionary neural network (ENN)&rdquo; is presented for the max cut problem of an undirected graph G(V, E) in this paper. The goal of the NP-hard problem is to find a partition of V into two disjoint subsets such that the cut size be maximized. The cut size is the sum of weights on edges in E whose endpoints belong to different subsets. The ENN combines the evolutionary initialization scheme of the neural state into the energy minimization criteria of the binary neural network. The performance of ENN is evaluated through simulations in randomly weighted complete graphs and unweighted random graphs with up to 1000 vertices. The results show that the evolutionary initialization scheme drastically improves the solution quality. ENN can always find better solutions than the maximum neural network, the mean field annealing, the simulated annealing, and the greedy algorithm

Abstract:In fractal compression a signal is encoded by the parameters of a contractive transformation whose fixed point (attractor) is an approximation of the original data. Thus fractal coding can be viewed as the optimization problem of finding in a set of admissible contractive transformations the transformation whose attractor is closest to a given signal. The standard fractal coding scheme based on the collage theorem produces only a suboptimal solution. We demonstrate by a reduction from MAXCUT that the problem of determining the optimal fractal code is NP-hard. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the intrinsic complexity of fractal coding. Additionally, we show that standard fractal coding is not an approximating algorithm for this problem

Abstract:We describe a randomized approximation algorithm which takes an instance of MAX 3SAT as input. If the instance-a collection of clauses each of length at most three-is satisfiable, then the expected weight of the assignment found is at least 7/8 of optimal. We provide strong evidence (but not a proof) that the algorithm performs equally well on arbitrary MAX 3SAT instances. Our algorithm uses semidefinite programming and may be seen as a sequel to the MAX CUT algorithm of Goemans and Williamson (1995) and the MAX 2SAT algorithm of Feige and Goemans (1995). Though the algorithm itself is fairly simple, its analysis is quite complicated as it involves the computation of volumes of spherical tetrahedra. Hastad has recently shown that, assuming P&ne;NP, no polynomial-time algorithm for MAX 3SAT can achieve a performance ratio exceeding 7/8, even when restricted to satisfiable instances of the problem. Our algorithm is therefore optimal in this sense. We also describe a method of obtaining direct semidefinite relaxations of any constraint satisfaction problem of the form MAX CSP(F), where F is a finite family of Boolean functions. Our relaxations are the strongest possible within a natural class of semidefinite relaxations

Abstract:We present practical algorithms for constructing partitions of graphs into a fixed number of vertex-disjoint subgraphs that satisfy particular degree constraints. We use this in particular to find k-cuts of graphs of maximum degree &Delta; that cut at least a (k-1)/k(1+1/(2&Delta;+k-1)) fraction of the edges, improving previous known bounds. The partitions also apply to constraint networks, for which we give a tight analysis of natural local search heuristics for the maximum constraint satisfaction problem. These partitions also imply efficient approximations for several problems on weighted bounded-degree graphs. In particular, we improve the best performance ratio for the weighted independent set problem to 3/(&Delta;+2), and obtain an efficient algorithm for coloring 3-colorable graphs with at most (3&Delta;+2)/4 colors

Abstract:This paper brings together several topics arising in distinct areas: polyhedral combinatorics, in particular, cut and metric polyhedra; matrix theory and semidefinite programming, in particular, completion problems for positive semidefinite matrices and Euclidean distance matrices; distance geometry and structural topology, in particular, graph realization and rigidity problems. Cuts and metrics provide the unifying theme. Indeed, cuts can be encoded as positive semidefinite matrices (this fact underlies the approximative algorithm for max-cut of Goemans and Williamson) and both positive semidefinite and Euclidean distance matrices yield points of the cut polytope or cone, after applying the functions 1/&pi; arccos(.) or root . When fixing the dimension in the Euclidean distance matrix completion problem, we find the graph realization problem and the related question of unicity of realization, which leads to the question of graph rigidity. Our main objective here is to present in a unified setting a number of results and questions concerning matrix completion, graph realization and rigidity problems. These problems contain indeed very interesting questions relevant to mathematical programming and we believe that research in this area could yield to cross-fertilization between the various fields involved. &copy; 1997 The Mathematical Programming Society, Inc.

Abstract:We describe links between a recently introduced semidefinite relaxation for the max-cut problem and the well known semidefinite relaxation for the stable set problem underlying the Lovasz's theta function. It turns out that the connection between the convex bodies defining the semidefinite relaxations mimics the connection existing between the corresponding polyhedra. We also show how the semidefinite relaxations can be combined with the classical linear relaxations in order to obtain tighter relaxations.

Abstract:An `Evolutionary Neural Network (ENN)' is presented for the max cut problem of an undirected graph G(V, E) in this paper. The goal of the NP-hard problem is to find a partition of V into two disjoint subsets such that the cut size be maximized. The cut size is the sum of weights on edges in E whose endpoints belong to different subsets. The ENN combines the evolutionary initialization scheme of the neural state into the energy minimization criteria of the binary neural network. The performance of ENN is evaluated through simulations in randomly weighted complete graphs and unweighted random graphs with up to 1000 vertices. The results show that the evolutionary initialization scheme drastically improves the solution quality. ENN can always find better solutions than the maximum neural network, the mean field annealing, the simulated annealing, and the greedy algorithm.

Abstract:A class of flow networks with inverse linear constraints is defined in the paper which leads to bounded lower and upper unbounded value of the flow. This flow is called a flow with inverse linear constraints (or ILC-flow). The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a non-zero ILC-flow have been derived. The capacity of the corresponding cutting sets is defined on the basis of the linear constraints and a number of relations are proved, characterizing the ILC-flow and the capacities of these cutting sets. It is proved that the minimal value of the ILC flow is always equal to the capacity of the maximal cutting set (max-cut min-flow theorem). The optimization problems for ILC-flow are defined as well as some directions for future investigations of this flow

Abstract:The best known approximation algorithm for graph MAX CUT, due to Goemans and Williamson, first finds the optimal solution a semidefinite program and then derives a graph cut from that solution. Building on this result, Karger, Motwani, and Sudan gave an approximation algorithm for graph coloring that also involves solving a semidefinite program. Solving these semidefinite programs using known methods (ellipsoid, interior-point), though polynomial-time, is quite expensive. We show how they can be approximately solved in &Otilde;(nm) time for graphs with n nodes and m edges

Abstract:We consider the weighted constraint satisfaction problem (W-CSP) which is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and a generalization of important combinatorial problems such as MAX CUT and MAX SAT. We prove non approximability properties of W-CSP and give improved approximations of W-CSP via randomized rounding of linear programming and semidefinite programming relaxations. Our algorithms are simple to implement and experiments show that they are run time efficient

Abstract:The max cut problem of a graph G(V,E) is to find a partition of V into two disjoint subsets such that the sum of weights of cut edges in E is maximized. This paper presents a binary neural network for this NP-complete problem, which is suitable for the hardware implementation on digital circuits. The shaking term is newly introduced in order to drastically improve the performance. The simulation results in weighted complete graphs and unweighted random graphs with up to 1000 vertices show that the binary neural network provides the satisfactory solution quality as compared to the latest algorithm

Abstract:We investigate the approximability properties of several weighted problems, by comparing them with the respective unweighted problems. For an appropriate (and very general) definition of niceness, we show that if a nice weighted problem is hard to approximate within r, then its polynomially bounded weighted version is hard to approximate within r-o(1). Then we turn our attention to specific problems, and we show that the unweighted versions of MIN VERTEX COVER, MIN SAT, MAX CUT, MAX DIRECTED CUT, MAX 2SAT, and MAX EXACT kSAT are exactly as hard to approximate as their weighted versions. We note in passing that MIN VERTEX COVER is exactly as hard to approximate as MIN SAT. In order to prove the reductions for MAX 2SAT, MAX CUT, MAX DIRECTED CUT, and MAX E3SAT we introduce the new notion of &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; set and we give an explicit construction of such sets. These reductions give new non-approximability results for these problems

Abstract:There are two main contributions of the present paper. In the first, we use the constructive version of the Regularity Lemma to give directly simple polynomial time approximation schemes for several graph &ldquo;subdivision&rdquo; problems in dense graphs including the Max Cut problem, the Graph Bisection problem, the Min l-way cut problem and Graph Separator problem. Arora, Karger and Karpinski (1992) gave the first PTASs for these problems whose running time is O(n<sup>o(1/e2)</sup>). Our PTASs have running time where the exponent of n is a constant independent of e. The central point here is that the Regularity Lemma provides an explanation of why these Max-SNP hard problems turn out to be easy in dense graphs. We also give a simple PTAS for dense versions of a special case of the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP)

Abstract:Declustering problems are well-known in the databases for parallel computing environments. In this paper, we propose a new similarity-based technique for declustering data. The proposed method can adapt to the available information about query distribution (e.g. size, shape and frequency) and can work with alternative atomic data-types. Furthermore, the proposed method is flexible and can work with alternative data distributions, data sizes and partition-size constraints. The method is based on max-cut partitioning of a similarity graph defined over the given set of data, under constraints on the partition sizes. It maximizes the chances that a pair of atomic data-items that are frequently accessed together by queries are allocated to distinct disks. We describe the application of the proposed method to parallelizing Grid Files at the data page level. Detailed experiments in this context show that the proposed method adapts to query distribution and data distribution, and that it outperforms traditional mapping-function-based methods for many interesting query distributions as well for several non-uniform data distributions

Abstract:A cut in a graph G=(V(G), E(G)) is the boundary &delta;(S) of some subset S&sube;V(G) and the maximum cut problem for G is to find the maximum number of edges in a cut. Let MC(G) denote this maximum. For any given 0&lt;&alpha;&lt;1, &epsiv;&gt;0, and &eta;, we give a randomized algorithm which runs in a polynomial time and which, when applied to any given graph G on n vertices with minimum degree &ges;&alpha;n, outputs a cut &delta;(S) of G with P[|&delta;(S)|&ges;MC(G)(1-&epsiv;)]&ges;1-2<sup>-&eta;</sup>. We also show that the proposed method can be used to approximate MAXIMUM ACYCLIC SUBGRAPH in the unweighted case

Abstract:The k-MAXCUT problem for undirected graphs G=(V,E) consists of finding a partition V=V<sub>1</sub>U...UV<sub>k</sub> such that the number of edges with endpoints in two different sets V<sub>i</sub> is maximized. We offer a new approach to this problem by showing that the combinatorial notion of block designs can be used to algorithmically obtain partitions which achieve lower bounds for which until now only existence proofs were known. In the case of k=2, we show that already known approaches can be improved by giving a simpler linear time algorithm which also yields better bounds. In particular, we give a linear time algorithm which achieves a bound of C.S. Edwards (1973) which was previously proved by intricate methods. For general k and graphs with m edges, we are able to compute partitions of size m&middot;(k-1)/k&middot;(1+1/&Delta;) if the maximum degree &Delta; of G is odd. The algorithms can also be applied to weighted graphs

Abstract:We survey and present new geometric and combinatorial properties of some polyhedra with application in combinatorial optimization, for example, the max-cut and multicommodity flow problems. Namely we consider the volume, symmetry group, facets, vertices, face lattice, diameter, adjacency and incidence relations and connectivity of the metric polytope and its relatives. In particular, using its large symmetry group, we completely describe all the 13 orbits which form the 275 840 vertices of the 21-dimensional metric polytope on 7 nodes and their incidence and adjacency relations. The edge connectivity, the i-skeletons and a lifting procedure valid for a large class of vertices of the metric polytope are also given. Finally, we present an ordering of the facets of a polytope, based on their adjacency relations, for the enumeration of its vertices by the double description method

Abstract:The constructive version of the Regularity Lemma was used to give directly simple polynomial time approximation schemes for several graph subdivision problems in dense graphs including the Max Cut problem, the Graph Bisection problem, the Min l-way cut problem and Graph Separator problem. A new version of the Regularity Lemma with considerably better constants is also introduced. This may be of use in other contexts where the Regularity Lemma is used.

Abstract:The paper deals with the complexity of the local search, a topic introduced by D.S.Johnson, C.H. Papadimitriou, and M. Yannakakis (1988). One consequence of their work, and a recent paper by A.A Schaffer and M. Yannakakis (1991), is that the local search does not provide a polynomial time algorithm for finding locally optimum solutions for several hard combinatorial optimization problems. This motivates us to seek &ldquo;easier&rdquo; instances for which the local search is polynomial. In particular. It has been proved by Schaffer and Yannakakis that the max-cut problem with the FLIP neighborhood is polynomial time local search (PLS) complete, and hence belongs among the most difficult problems in the PLS class. The FLIP neighborhood of a 2 partition is defined by moving a single vertex to the opposite class. We prove that, when restricted to cubic graphs, the FLIP local search becomes &ldquo;easy&rdquo; and finds a local max-cut in O(n<sup>2</sup>) steps. To prove the result. We introduce a class of integer linear programs associated with cubic graphs and provide a combinatorial characterization of their feasibility

Abstract:We present computational experiments for solving the max-cut problem using an eigenvalue relaxation. Our motivation is twofold-we are interested both in the quality of the bound, and in developing an efficient code to compute it. We describe the theoretical background of the method, an implementation of the algorithm, and its practical performance. The experiments have been done for various data sets, including random graphs of different densities, clustering problems, problems arising from quadratic 0-1 optimization, and some graphs taken from the literature. The basic algorithm is used to compute an upper and lower bound on the max-cut. The relative gap between these bounds is typically much less than 10%. We also present results where the basic algorithm is used in a &ldquo;branch and bound&rdquo; setting to find the exact value of the max-cut. The largest problems solved to optimality are dense geometric graphs with up to 100 nodes

Abstract:We propose a new similarity-based technique for declustering data. The proposed method can adapt to available information about query distributions, data distributions, data sizes and partition-size constraints. The method is based on max-cut partitioning of a similarity graph defined over the given set of data, under constraints on the partition sizes. It maximizes the chances that a pair of data-items that are to be accessed together by queries are allocated to distinct disks. We show that the proposed method can achieve optimal speed-up for a query-set, if there exists any other declustering method which will achieve the optimal speed-up. Experiments in parallelizing grid files show that the proposed method outperforms mapping-function-based methods for interesting query distributions as well for non-uniform data distributions

Abstract:This paper presents the results of an experimental study of graph partitioning. We describe a new heuristic technique, path optimization, and its application to two variations of graph partitioning: the max cut problem and the min quotient cut problem. We present the results of computational comparisons between this technique and the Kernighan-Lin algorithm, the simulated annealing algorithm, the FLOW-algorithm, the multilevel spectral algorithm, and the recent 0.878-approximation algorithm. The experiments were conducted on two classes of graphs that have become standard for such tests: random and random geometric. They show that for both classes of inputs and both variations of the problem, the new heuristic is competitive with the other algorithms, and holds a advantage for min quotient cut when applied to very large, sparse geometric graphs (10,000-100,000 vertices, average degree &les;10). In the last part of the paper, we describe an approach to analyzing graph partitioning algorithms from the statistical point of view. Every partitioning of a graph is viewed as a result achieved by a &ldquo;near greedy&rdquo; partitioning algorithm. The experiments show that for &ldquo;good&rdquo; partitionings, the number of non-greedy steps needed to obtain them is quite small; moreover, it is &ldquo;statistically&rdquo; smaller for better partitionings. This led us to conjecture that there exists an &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; distribution of the non-greedy steps that 0 the classes of graphs that we studied

Abstract:In this paper we propose approximation algorithms based on the non-oblivious local search technique, in order to solve NP-hard hypergraph colorability problems. Directed and undirected hypergraphs are generalizations of directed and undirected graphs, and has been widely used in computer science to represent concepts and structures from different areas. In this work we consider several hypergraph colorability problems for undirected and directed hypergraphs that are generalizations of many well known NP-hard optimization problems, such as Max Cut, Max Directed Cut, h-colorability, and Hypergraph 2-Colorability (also known as Set Splitting). In particular, by means of this approach we obtain the first approximation algorithms for several colorability problems on directed and undirected hypergraphs

Abstract:Remarkable breakthroughs have been made recently in obtaining approximate solutions to some fundamental NP-Complete problems, namely Max-Cut, Max k-Cut, Max-Sat, Max-Dicut, Max-Bisection, k Vertex Coloring, Independent Set, etc. These breakthroughs all involve polynomial time randomized algorithms based upon semidefinite programming, a technique pioneered by M. Goemans and D. Williamson (1994). In this paper, we give techniques to derandomize the above class of randomized algorithms, thus obtaining polynomial time deterministic algorithms with the same approximation ratios for the above problems. Note that Goemans and Williamson also gave an elegant method to derandomize their Max-Cut algorithm. We show here that their technique has a fatal flaw. The techniques we subsequently develop are very different from theirs. At the heart of our technique is the use of spherical symmetry to convert a nested sequence of n integrations, which cannot be approximated sufficiently well in polynomial time, to a nested sequence of just a constant number of integrations, which can be approximated sufficiently well in polynomial time

Abstract:We present randomized approximation algorithms for the maximum cut (MAX CUT) and maximum 2-satisfiability (MAX 2SAT) problems that always deliver solutions of expected value at least 0.87856 times the optimal value. These algorithms use a simple and elegant technique that randomly rounds the solution to a nonlinear programming relaxation. This relaxation can be interpreted both as a semidefinite program and as an eigenvalue minimization problem. The best previously known approximation algorithms for these problems had performance guarantees of &frac12; for MAX CUT and &frac34; for MAX 2SAT. Slight extensions of our analysis lead to a 0.79607-approximation algorithm for the maximum directed cut problem (MAX DICUT) and a 0.758-approximation algorithm for MAX SAT, where the best previously known approximation algorithms had performance guarantees of &frac14; and &frac34;, respectively. Our algorithm gives the first substantial progress in approximating MAX CUT in nearly twenty years, and represents the first use of semidefinite programming in the design of approximation algorithms

Abstract:For a graph G with e edges and n vertices, a maximum cardinality matching of G is a maximum subset M of edges such that no two edges of M are incident at a common vertex. The best known algorithm for solving the problem in general graphs requires O(n<sup>5</sup>/2) time. We first propose an approximate maximum cardinality matching algorithm that runs in O(e+n) sequential time yielding a matching of size at least e/n-1 improving the bound known before. For bipartite graphs, the algorithm yields a matching of size at least 2e/n. The proposed algorithms are extremely simple, and the derived lower bounds are existentially tight. Next, the proposed maximum cardinality matching algorithm is extended to the weighted case running in O(e+n) time. The problem of approximate maximum matching has a number of applications, for example in, Vertex Cover, TSP, MAXCUT, and VLSI physical design problems

Abstract:We propose a new similarity-based technique for declustering data. The proposed method can adapt to available information about query distributions, data distributions, data sizes and partition-size constraints. The method is based on max-cut partitioning of a similarity graph defined over the given set of data, under constraints on the partition sizes. It maximizes the chances that a pair of data-items that are to be accessed together by queries are allocated to distinct disks. We show that the proposed method can achieve optimal speed-up for a query-set, if there exists any other declustering method which will achieve the optimal speed-up. Experiments in parallelizing Grid Files show that the proposed method outperforms mapping-function-based methods for interesting query distributions as well for non-uniform data distributions.

Abstract:Given a graph G = (V,E), the metric polytope S(G) is defined by the inequalities x(F)-x(C\F) &le |F| - 1 for F is contained in or equals C, |F| odd, C cycle of G, and 0 &le x<inf>e</inf> &le 1 for e &isin; E. Optimization over S(G) provides an approximation for the max-cut problem. The graph G is called 1/d-integral if all the vertices of S(G) have their coordinates in {i/d | 0 &le i &le d}. We prove that the class of 1/d-integral graphs is closed under minors, and we present several minimal forbidden minors for 1/3-integrality. In particular, we characterize the 1/3-integral graphs on seven nodes. We study several operations preserving 1/d-integrality, in particular, the k-sum operation for 0 &le k &le 3. We prove that series parallel graphs are characterized by the following stronger property. All vertices of the polytope S(G) &isin; {x | l &le x &le u} are 1/3-integral for every choice of 1/3-integral bounds l, u on the edges of G.

Abstract:Continues the research on the effects of Monge structures in the area of combinatorial optimization. The authors show that three optimization problems become easy if the underlying cost matrix fulfils the Monge property: (A) the balanced max-cut problem, (B) the problem of computing minimum weight binary k-matchings and (C) the computation of longest paths in bipartite, edge-weighted graphs. In all three results, the authors first prove that the Monge structure imposes some special combinatorial property on the structure of the optimum solution, and then the authors exploit this combinatorial property to derive efficient algorithms

Abstract:We present randomized approximation algorithms for the MAX CUT and MAX 2SAT problems that always deliver solutions of expected value at least .87856 times the optimal value. These algorithms use a simple and elegant technique that randomly rounds the solution to a nonlinear programming relaxation. This relaxation can be interpreted both as a semidefinite program and as an eigenvalue minimization problem. We then show how to derandomize the algorithm to obtain approximation algorithms with the same performance guarantee of .87856. The previous best-known approximation algorithms for these problems had performance guarantees of &frac12; for MAX CUT and &frac34; for MAX 2SAT. A slight extension of our analysis leads to a .79607-approximation algorithm for the maximum directed cut problem, where a approximation algorithm was the previous best-known algorithm. Our algorithm gives the first substantial progress in approximating MAX CUT in nearly twenty years, and, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first use of semidefinite programming in the design of approximation algorithms

Abstract:Extends the concept of polynomial-time approximation algorithms to apply to problems for hierarchically specified graphs, many of which are PSPACE-complete. We present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for several standard PSPACE-hard problems considered in the literature. In contrast, we prove that finding &epsiv;-approximations for any &epsiv;&gt;0, for several other problems when the instances are specified hierarchically, is PSPACE-hard. We present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the following problems when the graphs are specified hierarchically: (1) minimum vertex cover, (2) maximum 3SAT, (3) weighted max cut, (4) minimum maximal matching and (5) bounded degree maximum independent set. In contrast, we show that for any &epsiv;&gt;0, obtaining &epsiv;-approximations for the following problems when the instances are specified hierarchically is PSPACE-hard: (1) the number of true gates in a monotone acyclic circuit when all input values are specified and (2) the optimal value of the objective function of a linear program. It is also shown that obtaining a performance guarantee of less than 2 is PSPACE-hard for the following problems when the instances are specified hierarchically: (1) high-degree subgraph, (2) k-vertex connected subgraph and (3) k-edge connected subgraph

Abstract:Mathematical expressions for the interconnection strengths and injected currents of a Hopfield type neural network are derived for the case where the network is expected to perform as an adaptive algorithm of an adaptive linear combiner (adaline). It is shown that the performance of the neural network is theoretically optimum. The problem is basically a quadratic programming one, and it is shown that the proposed neural network solution can be used for both cases where the variables are unconstrained and binary constrained. A representative application is given in the form of a simulation of a FIR filter

Abstract:The authors study an upper bound on the max-cut problem derived via a relaxation of the discrete problem to a continuous nonlinear convex problem, which can be solved efficiently. They demonstrate how far the approach can be pushed using advanced techniques from numerical linear algebra and nonsmooth optimization. Various classes of graphs with up to 50000 nodes and up to four million edges are considered. Since the theoretical bound can be computed only with a certain precision in practice, they use the duality between node- and edge-oriented relaxations to estimate the difference between the theoretical and the computed bounds

Abstract:In the asynchronous state transition of the Hopfield's type of neural networks with binary states, the state transition of neurons is trapped at one of local optima in a neighbourhood with radius of one Hamming distance, because all the transitions occur between two states at a distance of a single bit. In this paper, we present a neural network whose states transit directly through the Hamming distance of several bits and get off from such a local optimum in order to reach deterministically the global optimum. Thus, only when states are trapped at a local optimum in the asynchronous transition mode, the mode is changed into the linked transition mode in which some of the neurons change the states cooperatively and simultaneously according to threshold rule for the total input value concerned with the linked neurons. The simulation results for the unconstrained type of 0-1 combinatorial optimization problems with a quadratic function demonstrate the fundamentals of the proposed linked state transition

Abstract:We introduce the class of k-node label controlled (NLC) graphs and the class of k-NLC trees. Each k-NLC graph is an undirected tree-structured graph, where k is a positive integer. The class of k-NLC trees is a proper subset of the class of k-NLC graphs. Both classes include many interesting graph families. For instance, each partial k-tree is a (2<sup>k+1</sup>-1)-NLC tree and each co-graph is a 1-NLC graph. Furthermore, we introduce a very general method for the design of polynomial algorithms for NP-complete graph problems, where the input graphs are restricted to tree-structured graphs. We exemplify our method with the simple max-cut problem and the hamiltonian circuit property on k-NLC graphs

Abstract:The problem of partitioning the nodes of a random graph into two sets, so as to maximize the sum of the weights on the edges connecting nodes belonging to different sets, is addressed. This problem has important real-life counterparts, but has been proven to be NP-complete. As such, a number of heuristic solution techniques have been proposed in literature to address this problem. A stochastic optimization technique, simulated annealing, is proposed to find solutions for the max cut problem. Experiments verify that good solutions to the problem can be found using this algorithm in a reasonable amount of time

Abstract:We report solving odd-cycle inequalities linear programs to obtain Max-Cuts of instances of planar graphs obtained from the via minimization of the circuit layer assignment problem (where electrically common points have degree of at most three) in running times comparable to well-known fast approximate methods. This method does not require graph embeddings in the plane or graph transformations and runs in polynomial time. Furthermore, this odd-cycle LP relaxation of the Max-Cut problem on general graphs is proved to be as intractable as any other Max-Cut LP relaxation with respect to the question of being able to recognize exactly those problem inputs which have a 0-1 optimal solution to the linear program. This serves to strengthen the argument for attempting to solve non-planar Max-Cut problems by solving for the odd-cycle LP relaxation

Abstract:The authors describe the multilayer MCM (multichip module) routing problem, and propose an approach for routing high-performance MCMs with the objective of minimizing interconnect delays and crosstalk. They first introduce an approach for rapidly estimating the time-domain response of lossy transmission line trees, and propose a realistic second-order delay model for MCM interconnects. The delay model is used to guide a performance-driven global routing algorithm. Given the 2-D global paths, the next stage is layer assignment. An effective algorithm for constrained layer assignment is developed. Based on the best-known maxcut approximation algorithm (which performs well in practice), a maximal k-color ordering is formulated for minimizing both interlayer and intralayer crosstalk as well as crossings in 3-D MCM substrates. The authors also propose a strategy that exhibits a good tradeoff between circuit performance and design cost, instead of concentrating exclusively on a single objective such as area minimization

Abstract:The <i>k</i>-Min-Cut (<i>k</i>-Max-Cut) problem consists of partitioning the vertices of an edge weighted (unidirected) graph into <i>k</i> sets so as to minimize (maximize) the sum of the weights of the edges joining vertices in different subsets. The authors concentrate on the <i>k</i>-Max-Cut and <i>k</i>-Min-Cut problems defined over complete graphs that satisfy the triangular inequality, as well as on <i>d</i>-dimensional graphs. For the one-dimensional version of their partitioning problems, they present efficient algorithms for their solution as well as lower bounds for the time required to find an optimal solution, and for the time required to verify that a solution is an optimal one. They also establish a bound for the objective function value of an optimal solution to the <i>k</i>-Min-Cut and <i>k</i>-Max-Cut problems whose graph satisfies the triangle inequality. The existence of this bound is important because it implies that any feasible solution is a near-optimal approximation to such versions of the <i>k</i>-Max-Cut and <i>k</i>-Min-Cut problems

Abstract:The class PCP(f(n),g(n)) consists of all languages L for which there exists a polynomial-time probabilistic oracle machine that used O(f(n)) random bits, queries O(g(n)) bits of its oracle and behaves as follows: If x&isin;L then there exists an oracle y such that the machine accepts for all random choices but if x&notin;L then for every oracle y the machine rejects with high probability. Arora and Safra (1992) characterized NP as PCP(log n, (loglogn)<sup>O(1)</sup>). The authors improve on their result by showing that NP=PCP(logn, 1). The result has the following consequences: (1) MAXSNP-hard problems (e.g. metric TSP, MAX-SAT, MAX-CUT) do not have polynomial time approximation schemes unless P=NP; and (2) for some &epsiv;&gt;0 the size of the maximal clique in a graph cannot be approximated within a factor of n<sup>&epsiv;</sup> unless P=NP

Abstract:The problems of finding minimum-cost and maximum-cost sets of edge-disjoint cycles in a weighted undirected graph are studied. The importance of this problem is that it presents a `middle station' in two reductions for planar graphs-one between the max-cut problem and that of max-weight matching, and the other between the chinese postman problem and max-weight matching. The introduction of negative edge costs makes the reductions simple and efficient. The authors obtain new simpler algorithms for these two problems for planar graphs (where the max-weight matching problem can be solved very efficiently). The authors conclude that, in the case of planar weighted graphs (with arbitrary costs), all the three problems are mutually reducible and equivalent in terms of complexity

Abstract:We study facets of the cut cone C<inf>n</inf>, i.e., the cone of dimension 1/2 n(n-1) generated by the cuts of the complete graph on n vertices. Actually, the study of the facets of the cut cone is equivalent in some sense to the study of the facets of the cut polytope. We present several operations on facets and, in particular, a ``lifting'' procedure for constructing facets of C<inf>n+1</inf> from given facets of the lower dimensional cone C<inf>n</inf>. After reviewing hypermetric valid inequalities, we describe the new class of cycle inequalities and prove the facet property for several subclasses. The new class of parachute facets is developed and other known facets and valid inequalities are presented.

Abstract:Given a graph <i>G</i>, the maximum cut problem consists of finding the subset <i>S</i> of vertices such that the number of edges having exactly one endpoint in <i>S</i> is as large as possible. In the weighted version of this problem there are given real weights on the edges of <i>G</i>, and the objective is to maximize the sum of the weights of the edges having exactly one endpoint in the subset <i>S</i>. The authors consider the maximum cut problem and some related problems like maximum-2-satisfiability and weighted signed graph balancing. The authors describe the relation of these problems to the unconstrained quadratic 0-1 programming problem, and survey the known methods for lower and upper bounds to this optimization problem. The authors also give the relation between the related polyhedra, and describe some of the known and some new classes of facets for them

Abstract:The max cut problem, one of the NP-complete problems, was chosen to test the capability of an artificial neural network. The algorithm based on the maximum neural network was tested by 1000 randomly generated examples, including up to 300 vertex problems. The simulation result shows that the proposed parallel algorithm using the maximum neural network generates better solutions than Hsu's algorithm (1983) within one hundred iteration steps, regardless of the problem size

Abstract:The <i>k</i>-way graph partitioning problem can be transformed into the maximum <i>k</i>-cut problem using a proposed technique of graph modification. It is possible to transform the graph partitioning problem into the max-cut problem by incorporating node size information into the edge weight. After transformation, a very simple cost function can be devised which makes the proposed algorithm more efficient than the Kernighan-Lin (K-L) algorithm (1970). The computing time per iteration of the algorithm is <i>O</i>(<i>k</i>&times;<i>N</i><sup>2</sup>), where <i>N</i> is the number of nodes in the given graph. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the K-L algorithm both in the quality of solutions and in the elapsed time. Also, as the difference between the sizes of the nodes increases, the performance gap between the proposed algorithm and the K-L algorithm becomes larger

Abstract:Minimizing the number of vias in a two-layer circuit is known to reduce to a max cut problem in a planar graph. A similar reduction is presented that makes clear the planarity of the resulting graph. It is shown how to solve this problem in O(<i>n</i>/<sup>3/2</sup>log<i>n</i>) time, where <i>n</i> is the number of nodes of the graph. The first polynomial bound obtained for this problem was O(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>). Recently different authors also obtained an O(<i>n</i><sup>3/2</sup>log<i>n</i>) algorithm; however, they require a graph five times larger than the authors. Known results of polyhedral combinatorics are used to derive a min-max relation. If a heuristic is used, it is shown how to use linear programming duality to derive information about the quality of the heuristic solution

Abstract:For a (weighted) graph G and a cut C of G, it is shown that the problem of deciding whether C is maximal or not is polynomially equivalent to the problem that consists of deciding whether <i>C</i> is maximal or not and, in the case that it is not, finding a better solution <i>C</i>'. As a consequence, an optimality testing oracle may be used to design a polynomial time algorithm for approximately solving the (weighted) max-cut problem. This in turn implies that recognizing optimal cuts in an unweighted graph is NP-hard

Abstract:The support of a digraph is the undirected graph arising when directions of edges are ignored. The authors prove that recognizing supports of line digraphs of digraphs is an NP-complete problem. Then they observe that solvable cases of the directed max-cut problem arise from solvable cases of the maximum-weight stable set problem via supports of line digraphs; in particular, they investigate digraphs <i>G</i> such the the support of the line digraph of <i>G</i> is perfect

Abstract:It is shown that the k-way graph partitioning problem can be transformed into the maximum k-cut problem using a proposed technique of graph modification. It is shown that it is possible to transform the graph partitioning problem into the max-cut problem by incorporating node size information into the edge weight. After transformation, a very simple cost function can be devised which makes the proposed algorithm more efficient than the Kernighan-Lin (K-L) algorithm. The computing time per iteration of the algorithm is O(k &times; N<sup>2</sup>), where N is the number of nodes in the given graph. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the K-L algorithm both in the quality of solutions and in the elapsed time. It is also shown that, as the difference between sizes of the nodes increases, the performance gap between the proposed algorithm and the K-L algorithm becomes larger.

Abstract:Shows that the uniform <i>k</i>-way partitioning problem can be transformed into the max-cut problem using a graph modification technique. An iterative algorithm, based on the Kernighan-Lin method, for partitioning graphs is presented that exploits the problem equivalence property. The algorithm deals with nodes of various sizes without any performance degradation. The computing time per pass of the algorithm is <i>O</i>(<i>kN</i><sup>2</sup>), where <i>N</i> is the number of nodes in the given graph. In practice, only a small number of passes are typically needed, leading to a fast approximation algorithm for <i>k</i>-way partitioning. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the KL algorithm in the quality of solutions

Abstract:The authors discuss the problem of solving (approximately) combinatorial optimization problems on a Boltzmann machine. It is shown for a number of combinatorial optimization problems how they can be mapped directly onto a Boltzmann machine by choosing appropriate connection patterns and connection strengths. In this way maximizing the consensus in the Boltzmann machine is equivalent to finding an optimal solution of the corresponding optimization problem. The approach is illustrated by numerical results obtained by applying the model of Boltzmann machines to randomly generated instances of the independent set, the max cut, and the graph coloring problem. For these instances the Boltzmann machine finds near-optimal solutions whose quality is comparable to that obtained with sequential simulated annealing algorithms. The advantage of the Boltzmann machine is the potential for carrying out operations in parallel. For the problems the authors have been investigating, this results in a considerable speedup over the sequential simulated annealing algorithms

Abstract:Lichtenstein (1982) proposed the use of a `planar' version of 3SAT as a departure point for proofs of NP-completeness that would at once prove the general graph problem as well as its restriction to planar graphs to be NP-complete. Dyer and Frieze later proved that Planar 1in3SAT is also NP-complete. Of the three standard versions of 3SAT, on NAE3SAT remained open. The author provides a very simple reduction from NAE3SAT to Simple MaxCut, which respects Lichtenstein's conditions; since it is known that the planar version of (Simple) MaxCut is in <b>P</b>, so is the planar version of NAE3SAT, thereby settling the question (if in a somewhat unexpected way)

Abstract:The cut polytope P//c(G) of a graph G equals (V,E) is the convex hull of the incidence vectors of all edge sets of cuts of G. We show some classes of facet-defining inequalities of P//c(G). We describe three methods with which new facet-defining inequalities of P//c(G) can be constructed from known ones. In particular, we show that inequalities associated with chordless cycles define facets of this polytope; moreover, for these inequalities a polynomial algorithm to solve the separation problem is presented. We characterize the facet defining inequalities of P//c(G) if G is not contractible to K//5. We give a simple characterization of adjacency in P//c (G) and prove that for complete graphs this polytope has diameter one and that P//c(G) has the Hirsch property. A relationship between P//c(G) and the convex hull of incidence vectors of balancing edge sets of a signed graph is studied.

Abstract:Bandwidth restrictions are considered on several NP-complete problems, including the following: 3satisfiability, independent set, vertex cover, hitting set, simple max cut, 3-dimensional matching, exact cover by 3 sets, partition into triangles 3-colorability (even for planar graphs with maximum vertex degree four), directed and undirected Hamiltonian circuit and bandwidth minimization. It is shown that these problems when restricted to graphs, formulae, sets of triples, etc., of bandwidth <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>) are log space hard for the class of problems solvable by polynomial time nondeterministic algorithms that use simultaneously at most <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>) space. This class is denoted by NTISP (poly, <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>)). In fact, all of these problems restricted to bandwidth <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>), except for Hamiltonian circuit and bandwidth minimization, are shown to be log space complete for NTISP (poly, <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>))

Abstract:Two efficient algorithms are presented: One is an O( vertical V vertical )-time algorithm to determine whether a given graph G equals (V,E) has a subgraph homeomorphic to the Kuratowski graph K(3,3) and the other is an O( vertical V vertical **3 )-time algorithm to find a maximum cut of a given graph G equals (V,E) without subgraphs homeomorphic to K(3,3).

Abstract:Given a graph <i>G</i>=[<i>V</i>,<i>E</i>] with positive edge weights, the max-cut problem is to find a cut in <i>G</i> such that the sum of the weights of the edges of this cut is as large as possible. Let &Gscr;(<i>K</i>) be the class of graphs whose longest odd cycle is not longer than 2<i>K</i>+1, where <i>K</i> is a nonnegative integer independent of the number <i>n</i> of nodes of <i>G</i>. The authors present an O(<i>n</i><sup>4K</sup>) algorithm for the max-cut problem for graphs in &Gscr;(<i>K</i>). The algorithm is recursive and is based on some properties of longest and longest odd cycles of graphs

Abstract:Given the geometry of wires used to interconnect signals on an integrated circuit, the problem is to assign layers to the segments of these wires so that the electric performance of the circuit is optimized. A special case of this problem regarding the minimization of the total number of layer changes along wires (realized by contacts) has been believed to be NP-complete for quite some time, even when only two layers were used. This paper shows that for any measure of optimality which depends on the sum of the performances of individual wires, the layer assignment problem can be solved for two layers in polynomial time using a max-cut algorithm for planar graphs. Obviously, this disputes the above mentioned NP-completeness conjecture. The treatment presented here constitutes a better understanding of the problem than was obtained before and leads to further results concerning other optimality criteria, such as metal maximization

Abstract:Given a graph G equals left bracket V,E right bracket with positive edge weights, the max-cut problem is to find a cut in G such that the sum of the weights of the edges of this cut is as large as possible. Let G(K) be the class of graphs whose longest odd cycle is not longer than 2K plus 1, where K is a nonnegative integer independent of the number n of nodes of G. An O(n**4**K) algorithm for the max-cut problem for graphs in G(K) is presented. The algorithm is recursive and is based on some properties of longest and longest odd cycles of graphs.

Abstract:A new class of graphs, called weakly bipartite graphs, is introduced. A graph is called weakly bipartite if its bipartite subgraph polytope coincides with a certain polyhedron related to odd cycle constraints. The class of weakly bipartite graphs contains for instance the class of bipartite graphs and the class of planar graphs. It is shown that max-cut problem can be solved in polynomial time for weakly bipartite graphs. The polynomial algorithm presented is based on the ellipsoid method and an algorithm that computes a shortest path of even length

Abstract:This paper shows that a number of NP-complete problems remain NP complete even when their domains are substantially restricted. First the authors show the completeness of simple Max Cut (Max Cut with edge weights restricted to value 1), and, as a corollary, the completeness of the Optimal Linear Arrangement problem. The authors then show that even if the domains of the Node Cover and Directed Hamiltonian Path problems are restricted to planar graphs, the two problems remain NP-complete, and that these and other graph problems remain NP-complete even when their domains are restricted to graphs with low node degrees. For Graph 3-Colorability, Node Cover, and Undirected Hamiltonian Circuit, the authors determine essentially the lowest possible upper bounds on node degree for which the problems remain NP-complete
